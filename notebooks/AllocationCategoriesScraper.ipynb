This allocation is\\r\\n based on pupil CTE credits in the 2020-2021 school year, primarily in non-CTE designated high schools, and also provides\\r\\n supplemental funding in CTE-designated high schools.  As a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the remote learning grading\\r\\n policy, NX marks have been included until final marks are made available. Funding will also support the STEAM program, which\\r\\n will provide shared CTE instruction across a predetermined group of CTE and non-CTE schools in Brooklyn.  This allocation will\\r\\n enable high schools to offer and expand high quality CTE programs, and provide for long-term sustainability.  \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result of the impact of COVID-19, NX marks in CTE classes are considered to be earned pupil credits for the purposes \\r\\nof this SAM. Subsequent rounds of funding under this SAM will be modified as pupil credits are finalized. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for Academic HS:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE programs in non-CTE designated schools have been selected based upon their commitment to, and continued development of,\\r\\n high quality CTE programs.  With an emphasis on the expansion and improvement of CTE programming, funds will now support the \\r\\nhigher cost to provide students and staff with the CTE experiences necessary to maintain a high quality CTE program.  Funding \\r\\nwill be allocated in a tiered structure that addresses significant factors in CTE programming, such as CTE class-size requirements,\\r\\n costs for equipment and consumable materials, industry training for teachers, student work experiences, and lab upgrades.  Schools \\r\\nreceiving these funds must dedicate these resources for the overall improvement and growth of CTE in their school. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for FSF Portfolio HS:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools that receive FSF Specialized Academic or Specialized Audition Portfolio per pupil funding will receive a reduced CTE per \\r\\ncapita, given that these schools already receive incremental per pupil funding through the formula, but also bear additional incremental\\r\\n costs relative to other specialized schools without CTE programs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for FSF CTE designated HS:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE designated high schools receive resources in Fair Student Funding (FSF) based on the relative cost factors necessary to operate \\r\\ndifferent CTE programs of study, assuming standard CTE credits.  This allocation provides supplemental funding in CTE designated high \\r\\nschools where students are enrolled in intensive CTE program course sequences. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for the Brooklyn STEAM Center:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (S.T.E.A.M.) Center is a partnership between the DOE, Brooklyn Navy Yard (BNY), \\r\\nthe Brooklyn Historical Society and NY State.  The innovative hub model will offer 5 CTE Pathways across 8 area Brooklyn high schools.  \\r\\nThe model is intended to increase socioeconomic diversity, to improve student achievement, and to provide students with high quality, \\r\\nindustry aligned curriculum in addition to real-time access to industry partners with on-site work-based learning experiences at the Navy Yard \\r\\nand access to relevant college coursework provided by the City University of New York.  Funding will be used to cover the cost of equipment, \\r\\nmaintenance costs, consumable materials, supplies and staffing.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUses of Funds:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThese supplemental CTE funds may only be used for the following categories of expenditure: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment Maintenance and repair\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupplies and materials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer session funding for CTE teacher training (externships, professional learning, credentialing, curriculum development and academic integration)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Staff Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYSED approved curriculum and assessments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudent wages for work based learning opportunities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE teacher salaries\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE association fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE Lab updates\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe CTE team will work with assigned schools to develop and implement effective spending plans that meet the unique programmatic and fiscal\\r\\n needs of each school.  Use of these funds will be closely monitored and schools must adhere to the co-developed plan.  Future allocation \\r\\nconsiderations will be contingent on the proper use of these limited resources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequired CTE Program Coding in STARS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout the school year, schools will be required to enter, maintain, and update data within the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager.  \\r\\nAll CTE program course sequences must be clearly defined, aligned to NYSED program approval forms, and submitted in the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager by October 29, 2021.\\r\\nThis includes all necessary adjustments/amendments to approved CTE sequences in the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager, including required/optional course codes, assigned credit,\\r\\nor technical assessment changes, which have to be reviewed and approved by the CTE Program Quality Team. Prior to the approval of a new or revised CTE sequence schools must notify\\r\\nthe CTE Program Quality Team using the  \\n\\nProgram Manager Change Form \\n\\n \\r\\nby e-mailing \\n\\n\\r\\nCTEInfo@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n. Students MUST be enrolled in an approved CTE sequence when the student/school declares the students\\' intent to complete the CTE program, but no later than November 12, 2021.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents also need to be scheduled for the courses and technical assessments that comprise the approved CTE sequence in which they are enrolled. \\r\\nFailure to gain CTE sequence approval in STARS, enroll students in approved CTE sequences in the STARS Program Manager, and/or schedule students in the \\r\\nclasses and for the technical assessments that comprise their enrolled CTE sequences, will lead to funding loss. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequired CTE Data Reporting for NYSED Approved Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTechnical Assessments \\n\\n\\r\\nSchools are now required to schedule and confirm CTE Final Exam scores using STARS and the ATS EVER function. Schools will have all of their students that have taken\\r\\n and passed all three components of the CTE Technical assessments (i.e., written, practical, school-based project/portfolio). \\r\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork-Based Learning Hours \\n\\n\\r\\nSchools with NYSED Approved programs are required to use the WBL Hours Course code to report CTE concentrators who have met or exceeded the 54 hours of work-based learning.\\r\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional guidance will be included in the CTE FAQ.  \\n\\n\\r\\nFailure to submit this data will lead to funding loss. Further information on this process may be found at the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSTARS Wiki CTE Homepage\\n\\n.  Questions about this program can be sent to \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nCTEInfo@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n.\\r\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations for the CTE supplement is based on student data on CTE credits, differentiated by CTE tier.  Round 1 allocates 50% of each school\\'s anticipated\\r\\n CTE allocation.  For the round 1 allocation, data on credits attempted is based on annualized 2020-21 data, with the exception of schools on a single term \\r\\nannual cycle.  For single term schools, data is based on credits attempted in SY 2019-20. Refer to Table 2 for details. This allocation will be adjusted in \\r\\nthe fall, based on SY 2020-21 full year data, on CTE credits attempted. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information on the FSF CTE tiers, refer to pages\\n\\n 34-35\\n\\n of the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFSF Guide.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding will be placed in the \\n\\nTL CTE Programs HS\\n\\n and \\n\\nTL STEAM HS \\n\\nallocation categories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools\\' Fair Student Funding Funds over Formula allocations will be reduced up to the amount of the CTE Program\\r\\nallocation, capped at the Funds over Formula amount.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE&E Early College\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA) Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn December 27, 2020, the President signed into law the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (CRRSA). Funds must be used to help meet \\r\\na wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs and \\r\\naddress needs essential to keeping schools open. CRRSA funds are temporary and must be used for the supplemental purposes detailed in this SAM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations funded with these stimulus dollars will have \"CRRSA\" be noted in the allocation category (AC). Cost factors in Galaxy associated with these \\r\\nACs may be limited. Schools are responsible for reviewing SAM documentation and guidance to ensure that funding is used for eligible purposes only as outlined in this SAM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible \\r\\nprogramming as soon as possible. CRRSA stimulus funding is temporary, and should not be expected in subsequent school years. Additionally, schools should be \\r\\nmindful of long-term budget sustainability of any new programming supported with stimulus funding. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds \\r\\ncannot be used to hire full-time staff. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, \\r\\nincluding timesheets, must be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPort Richmond High School launched the first Grades 9-14 program in Staten Island focusing on two areas: Computer Science and Health Sciences. \\r\\nThese programs will be developed in partnership with DOE, CUNY, and College of Staten Island along with relevant industry partners.  Funding will be \\r\\nused to hire one full-time CTE licensed teacher in the appropriate certificate title for the health sciences after agreement with partners on the\\r\\nprogram\\'s focus and pathway.

Academic performance is measured as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nES/MS:\\n\\n The number and percentage of students who scored at Level 1 on state exams for grades 3-8 out of students who took the math exam; \\r\\n\\t\\tand the number and percentage of students who scored at Level 1 on state exams for grades 3-8 out of students who took the English exam;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHS:\\n\\n Students in grades 9-12 who scored below 65 on all 2019 math Regents exam attempts (of those who sat for a January, June and/or August 2019 exam);\\r\\n\\t\\t and students in grades 9-12 who scored below 65 on all 2019 English Regents exam attempts (of those who sat for a January, June and/or August 2019 exam).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2020-2021 Economic Need Index multiplied by the 2021-2022 projected register.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo-thirds of the funds are being allocated on the basis of performance and one-third based on Economic Need Index indicators. This weighting is achieved by multiplying the schoolâ€™s estimated \\r\\nperformance count by a factor of 2. However, any school with performance or poverty registers that would have generated an allocation of less than $5,000 will not receive any tax levy funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor FY 2022 there will be a one-time infusion of Title IV Well Rounded funding added to the program so that schools can provide additional supports for students due to the challenges \\r\\nbrought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Title IV portion of the funding is also allocated based on performance and Economic Need Index indicators, however, all schools will receive a base \\r\\nallocation of $1,500. Fringe benefits are required when scheduling Title IV funding. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuidelines for Supplemental Allocation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools receiving this allocation should use these funds to support the implementation of Academic Intervention Services.  The New York State Education Department (NYSED) issued this memo on \\r\\nSeptember 11, 2018 outlining a two-step method to assist in identifying students in grades 3-8 who are eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be used to implement your AIS plan as described in your 2021-2022 Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP). Funds can be spent on activities such as research-based intervention programs, \\r\\nprotocols and related assessment tools for use in the various targeted intervention tiers of service, Saturday academies, after-school sessions, computer and web-based programs aligned with Common \\r\\nCore Standards and a targeted, diagnostic-prescriptive model of intervention, as well as other types of support in accordance with the school's overall academic intervention services plan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools' FSF, Funds over Formula, allocations will be reduced up to the amount of the ELA/Math Supplemental Support Services allocation, capped at the Funds over Formula amount.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds for the basic program will be allocated in the \\n\\nTL ELA/Math Student Support\\n\\n allocation category.

This memorandum allocates supplemental tax levy funds to support increases incurred in major reimbursable funding streams.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere possible, allocation adjustments for collective bargaining have been folded into existing tax levy allocation categories.  Where allocations are split-funded between tax levy and reimbursable sources,\\r\\nfunding was added to the tax levy allocation category to cover the cost of collective bargaining across the entire program.  By using this strategy, schools will only have to manage discrete collective \\r\\nbargaining allocations in minimal instances.  Where collective bargaining is included in program allocations, details are provided in the program allocation memorandum.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome programs will have to bear the cost of salary increases, e.g. private, foundation, City Council, intra-city, and self-sustaining grants.  \\r\\nFunding for collective bargaining increases for services in competitive grants must be self-funded within the grant award amount.  \\r\\nTherefore, all grant proposals and applications must account for collective bargaining increases in future fiscal years as per current labor agreements.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer Session, Per Diem, Prep Coverage, and F Status Rates\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage teacher salaries, city-wide average salaries for mandated services, such as speech and counseling, and forecast actual salaries of staff have \\r\\nbeen updated in Galaxy for all known collective bargaining payroll events.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGalaxy Updated for New Rates for FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere selected titles will receive collective bargaining increases at various dates throughout FY 2022, multiple rates of pay will be in effect over the course of the year.  \\r\\nIn order to normalize these varying rates and effective dates for annual budgeting purposes, the rates in Galaxy for scheduling selected bulk job titles are based on the \"cash value\" for each title.  \\r\\nThe cash value is the net amount of the increase paid over the course of the entire fiscal year for all payroll dates, based on the percentage increase and effective date.  \\r\\nThe \"cash value\" rate will be used for scheduling budget items for titles in unions with increases occurring in the latter part of the year.  \\r\\nFor unions with collective bargaining increases that take place earlier in the year, the rate will reflect the collective bargaining increase for the entire year.  \\r\\nFor other titles cumulative increases through the end of FY 2022 are reflected in rates for scheduling in the \\n\\n\\r\\nFY 2022 rate table\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPayrolls will be paid at the rate in effect at the time service is performed.  Schools should monitor expenditures in bulk jobs on the \\n\\nBulk Job and OTPS Inquiry\\n\\n screen in Galaxy \\r\\nthroughout the year and adjust scheduled amounts accordingly to align budgets with projected expenses.  Bulk jobs should be fully scheduled to cover all expenses incurred through the end of the school year. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShift of CB from Fair Student Funding to SAM 06\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCB was previously provided in FSF for staff in funding streams not funded in the initial allocation release, as those allocations are subject to review and may be issued at a later date. \\r\\nThe CB for these staff will now be funded in this SAM.  This change will result in the CB funds allocated in FSF being more aligned with the staff scheduled by schools in FSF. \\r\\nThis change has no impact on the amount of funding schools receive for CB; it only shifts which allocation category is used to allocate CB for these staff.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Process\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs each allocation is issued, collective bargaining will be handled according to the guidelines outlined above.  Where collective bargaining cannot be accommodated within the program, \\r\\nfunds will be allocated in the discrete tax levy allocation category for collective bargaining.  This SAM will be updated accordingly for each allocation that requires this method to provide funding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Categories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollective bargaining that could not be folded into program funding will be issued in the following allocation categories, depending on school type\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL CB School Staff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL CB School Staff CW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL CB School Staff D79\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 06, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachments:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nCollective Bargaining for School-Based Staff Allocations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: af\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Funding will be entered in Galaxy on May 24, 2021 as per the tables linked below.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis memorandum funds the Summer Rising program, a bold vision for summer learning that is student-centered, experiential and academically rigorous. \\r\\nSummer Rising provides summer instructional opportunities for all students while continuing to serve mandated students in grades 3-8, and high school students in need of credits towards graduation.  \\r\\nThe Summer Rising programs is a continuation of our work to deliver equity and excellence to all students and a response to the current needs of our students. Two days of professional development will be provided for teachers, and one day of professional development\\r\\nwill be provided for education paraprofessionals.  Funds for professional development will be allocated directly to schools. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA).  Funds must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, \\r\\nincluding activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented student subgroups.  \\r\\nARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA for Academic Recovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the United States Department of Education (USDOE) refers to as the \"learning loss\".\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAcademic recovery activities offered in the Summer Rising program will be funded by ARPA. As these are federal stimulus funds, they cannot be transferred from school-to-school, and must be maintained and scheduled in the allocated school location.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Budget Modification Due Date and FS10s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll streams of Summer Rising funding should be fully scheduled by schools and approved by BCOs by \\n\\n4:00 pm on July 16, 2021.\\n\\n  As many program components are funded using \\n\\nARPA, Title III, and Title IV\\n\\n, \\r\\nall programs must be fully scheduled by schools and approved by BCOs for the FS10 snapshot to be taken. Approved funds will appear on the city\\'s FS10 financial document and will be submitted along with \\r\\nbudget narratives for review and approval by NYSED.  All ESSA funds should be scheduled in support of the school CEP.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising programs offered this year include:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Academic Support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Supports for Summer Rising Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Support for Multilingual Learners\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Support for Students with Disabilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtended School Year Summer Rising (ESY)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nASD/Nest/Horizon Summer Rising Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Pre-K Class ESY Program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising Discovery Program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCTE Summer Enrichment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArtist Murals and Pop Up Performance Grants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWork-Based Learning (WBL) Partnership Incubator\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Summer Rising Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgrammatic Set Asides\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInformation on each aspect of Summer Rising is below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA. Summer Rising Academic Support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nWith the goal of supporting student needs in a 12-month school year, the per capita funding methodology for summer 2021 is described below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSummer Rising will support pupils in grades K-8 and 9-12, including those who are mandated, at the school level in districts 1-32.  The program for grades K-8 will run from 8:30 am to 12:30 pm, \\r\\n(or a similar 4-hour window) Monday to Thursday beginning July 6 and ending August 12. For grades 9-12, the program will run from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm (or a similar 5-hour window) Monday to Friday \\r\\nbeginning July 6 and ending August 13.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince many students will be attending summer school in their own school buildings, schools can use their current curriculum for ELA and mathematics. Using existing curriculum supports continuity of \\r\\ninstruction and prepare for success in the fall. Where affiliated schools use different curriculum, digital curriculum options are available on ShopDOE that schools can use their summer funds to purchase.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding is allocated directly to schools for the academic support program.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrades K-8:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools serving grades K-8 will receive an allocation based on the number of students who attend Summer Rising in July and August of 2021. Funding will be issued in two installments as follows:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInitial allocation\\n\\n: Schools will receive an allocation based on the number of students anticipated to enroll in the summer program, at an applied attendance factor of 75%. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal allocation - issued in Fall 2021\\n\\n: Where the number of students who attended one or more days of the summer program was greater than the initial allocation, \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthe school will receive an increase in funding. Allocation adjustments will be made only where schools have increased student populations; no reductions will be made\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrades 9-12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh school students who need credits towards graduation will continue to have access to credit-bearing courses over the summer. Schools serving grades 9-12 will receive an \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallocation based on the number of students who attend Summer Rising in July and August of 2021, including students who are over 21 per NYSED guidance. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFunding will be issued in two installments as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInitial allocation\\n\\n: Schools will receive an allocation based on the number of students anticipated to enroll in the summer program, at an applied attendance factor of 75%. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinal allocation - issued in Fall 2021\\n\\n: Where the number of students who attended one or more days of the summer program was greater than the initial allocation, \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe school will receive an increase in funding. Allocation adjustments will be made only where schools have increased student populations; no reductions will be made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRemote Option for Students in Grades 3-8:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs part of Summer Rising\\'s bold vision for summer learning to be student-centered, experiential, academically rigorous, culturally \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tresponsive and sustaining, an option to attend summer school remotely is available to families of \"mandated\" students in grades 3-8 who need additional academic support \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tfor promotion. Programs are borough-based, and students will attend the remote program within their borough. Along with the teachers to support students in their required \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tcourses, each site will have a principal in charge, site supervisor, and support staff for programming, attendance and guidance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations for the remote program will be placed in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Remote Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCBO Staffing Support:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools at Summer Rising sites are partnered with CBOs to provide students with a holistic experience that combines strong academic supports, \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tsocial emotional learning and enrichment programming. For sites that are projected to enroll more students than CBO capacity can support, funding will be allocated for schools \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tto hire DOE substitute staff so that all students can fully engage in CBO-led activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations for the CBO staffing support will be placed in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery CBO Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere schools are consolidating in the 2021-2022 school year, Summer Rising funding will be provided to the prevailing school. The allocation methodologies identified above will be applied after the relevant factors of the dissolving school are added to the prevailing school.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAllocations for the academic portion of the summer program will be placed in the \\n\\nTL Summer Rising Shared\\n\\n and \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation categories. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Summer Rising\\n\\n funds must be scheduled in the school location where the funds were allocated. As such, \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery \\r\\nSummer Rising\\n\\n funds were allocated only to host sites.  Feeder sites may transfer \\n\\nTL Summer Rising Shared\\n\\n funds to host sites using the school-to-school transfer facility.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor this portion of the summer program funded by ARPA, the appropriate program description must be selected in the program field dropdown in Galaxy as noted below to identify funds that are being spent to make up for academic recovery.  \\r\\nSchools should select the program description from the list available and not type the descriptions in directly.  \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Summer Rising\\n\\n funding will not come up in Galaxy as a funding recommendation unless one of the program \\r\\ndescriptions is used to describe the item.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrop-down Program Description\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Academic Needs Assessments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Evidence-based Interventions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Family Engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Student Attendance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Intervention for Under-Represented Students\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Afterschool Programming\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA AR Extended Day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote these program descriptions are also required for the middle school ASD summer program referenced later in this SAM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Summer Rising Shared\\n\\n allocation categories can be transferred between schools for shared services as needed via the School Transfer Request function in Galaxy.\\r\\nExamples of shared services include those where:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipals decide to collaborate with other schools on a given service; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds are transferred from a school or group of schools to a host school or payroll site for payroll and timekeeping purposes for a given service; or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServices are clustered for many schools. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIt is recommended that for grades K-8 a per capita of $238 and for grades 9-12 a per capita of $203 be used for pupils as the amount to be transferred to the host payroll school unless the schools agree upon a different amount based on the above.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB.\\tNew Supports for Summer Rising Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis program will provide a bridge to next school year and allow students to reconnect with one another and with their schools. In recognition of the wide-ranging needs of students attending summer school due to COVID-19, \\r\\nand to better enable schools to plan for the pandemic-related challenges of school opening in the fall, schools will receive funding for the following support services.  \\r\\nWhere these services are funded with ARPA, they must be scheduled in the school location where the funds were allocated, and cannot be transferred to another school. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssistant Principal Support:\\n\\n Schools serving students in grades K-8 will receive funding for the equivalent of one assistant principal, which can be used to fund a 12-month assistant principal \\r\\nor supervisor per session for the summer to provide supplemental support supervising summer learning.   (K-8 sites will continue to receive support for a centrally-funded assistant principal as per prior practice.)  \\r\\nFunds are allocated to be scheduled by schools in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery AP Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.  These funds expire on \\n\\nAugust 31, 2021\\n\\n. If your school is hiring a 12-month assistant principal to work full-time during \\r\\nJuly and August who is not on your school\\'s Table of Organization, and won\\'t be working in your school during the regular school year, contact your BCO budget director for assistance.  \\n\\nUpdate (as of May 28, 2021):\\n\\n  Where schools have accruals at the end of the summer, 25% of the amount of the schools\\' Summer Rising \\r\\nassistant principal allocation will be carried forward for use on supervisor per session after \\n\\nAugust 31, 2021\\n\\n.  School expenditures will be evaluated and funds reissued at the end of September.\\r\\nUpdate \\n\\n(as of January 14, 2022):\\n\\n  This allocation has been updated to fund all assistant principals serving as site supervisors in all elementary, middle and high schools in the Summer Rising program. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCounseling Support:\\n\\n As part of the City and the DOE\\'s focus on the social and emotional well-being of our students, Summer Rising sites serving students in grades K-12 will be allocated \\r\\nfunding to hire one counselor (social worker or guidance counselor).  Any unused funds may be used during the regular school year for the same purpose only. Funds are allocated to be scheduled by schools in the \\r\\n\\n\\nTitle IV Safe Healthy Counseling Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducation Paraprofessional Support:\\n\\n Summer Rising sites serving students in grades K-12 will be allocated funding to hire one education paraprofessional for supplemental support services \\r\\nto assist special education students during the summer. Schools will receive additional allocations for paraprofessionals based on identified need beyond the one base position allocated. \\r\\nAny unused funds may be used during the regular school year for the same purpose only. Funds are allocated to be scheduled by schools in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Para Summer Rising \\n\\nallocation category.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Development:\\n\\n Summer Rising professional learning will take place on July 1st and 2nd will be school-based and school driven. Summer Rising sites will plan professional learning aligned to their own curriculum, \\r\\nsocial emotional programs/protocols, and other topics to support their students. All professional learning will take place at the Summer Rising site, and funding will be provided to \\r\\nsupport two days of professional learning for teachers and one day of professional learning for paraprofessionals. Allocations for professional development will be placed in the \\n\\nTL Summer Rising Shared \\n\\nallocation category. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Sites:\\n\\n For Summer Rising sites that have recently opened to support increased enrollment, program and material needs will be reviewed and allocated on an as-needed basis. Funding was previously allocated for the academic portion \\r\\nof the program in the initial allocation.  New supports for the Summer Rising program (APs, counseling, ed paras and PD) will follow the same methodology as described above. \\r\\nAllocations will be placed in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Summer Rising \\n\\nallocation category. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC.\\tSummer Rising Support for Multilingual Learner/English Language Learners (MLs/ELLs)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents in Grades K-12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nStudents in grade K-12 who are entering, emerging, transitioning, and expanding multilingual learners who attend Summer Rising will be prioritized for instructional support by an English as a New Language (ENL)\\r\\nteacher as part of their academic day.  Students will receive instruction targeting language and literacy development and access to grade-level content through an ENL integrated co-teaching and/or ENL \\r\\nstandalone instructional model that can also include small-group instruction and/or one-to-one support \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSites in Districts 1-32 with a minimum of 20 students in grades K-8 or 9-12 will receive an allocation of at minimum one (1) ENL teacher per 50 MLs/ELLs.  \\r\\nEnrollment projections are based on SY20-21 in-person and blended ML/ELL attendance.  In the event that ML/ELL enrollment exceeds the projected allocation in this memo, schools should direct this Title III \\r\\nfunding to hire teachers for entering and emerging MLs/ELLs first and then utilize Part A: Summer Academic Support (above) to deliver sufficient instructional support to MLs/ELLs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Support for Entering and Emerging MLs/ELLs in Grades K-8:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nStudents who are entering and emerging MLs/ELLs who attend Summer Rising will be prioritized for additional instructional support during the academic day by an English as a New Language (ENL) teacher.\\r\\nMLs/ELLs at the entering and emerging proficiency levels are to be programmed through the ENL standalone instructional model.  Entering and emerging MLs/ELLs in grades K-6 will receive instruction targeting language and \\r\\ndiscourse and strengthening literacy skills using the pre-selected, grade-level appropriate, ENL Standalone curriculum at no cost:  Cengage/NatGeo Panorama: Social Studies.\\r\\nMLs/ELLs in grades 7-8 may utilize the no-cost thematic digital units created by DML, made available through TeachHub  Schools should prioritize securing a partnership with vetted  MTAC Arts organizations experienced in \\r\\nco-supporting ENL teachers and designing experiences for MLs/ELLs during the ENL Standalone block.Guidance on the MTAC process and procurement will be shared shortly by the Division of Multilingual Learners.\\r\\nSchools should utilize Part A: Summer Academic Support funds (above) for these arts partnerships.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport for MLs/ELLs in Grades 9-12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSummer program design for MLs/ELLs in grades 9-12 should also include a certified ENL teacher. All MLs/ELLs regardless of proficiency levels or other designations (e.g., SIFE, dually designated) \\r\\nshould be prioritized for summer programming that can increase their language, literacy, and content area learning so they return in September ready to engage in the new academic year. \\r\\nSchools should offer programming that addresses the specific needs of ML/ELL subgroups: Newcomers, SIFE, Long-term ELLs, dually designated MLs/ELLs. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations for this program will be placed in the following allocation category: \\n\\nTitle III Summer Rising ML Support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nD. Summer Rising Literacy Supports for Students with Disabilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrades K-12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nStudents with disabilities attending Summer Rising will receive additional instructional support by a Special Education Intervention teacher as part of their summer day. \\r\\nSites will receive an allocation for (1) Special Education intervention teacher to 25 students with disabilities.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSpecial Education teachers will provide small group intervention instruction to students with using a research-based literacy intervention program, in a group size no larger than 5, in 30 minute intervals.\\r\\nThe balance of the Special Education Teacher Interventionist schedule will be used to provide direct and indirect programmatic support to students with disabilities including but not limited to: consulting \\r\\nwith Summer Rising Teachers, accommodating and adapting instructional materials, push-in instruction if applicable\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAny unused funds may be used during the regular school year for the same purpose only. Funds are allocated to be scheduled by schools in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE Support Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE. Extended School Year (ESY)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrades K-12:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis program funds extended school year special education services. \\r\\nIEP teams determine whether a student requires extended school year \\r\\nspecial education services during the summer in order to prevent \\r\\nsubstantial regression. Substantial regression would be indicated by a student\\'s inability \\r\\nto maintain developmental levels due to a loss of skill, set of skill competencies or knowledge \\r\\nduring the months of July and August. Programs must operate for a minimum of 30 days and focus \\r\\non the areas in which the student is expected to experience regression. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFunds are allocated to schools to support the following services as needed: assistant principals, teachers, coverage, secretaries, paraprofessionals, educational software, materials, and related service providers. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFunding is also provided to schools hosting summer remote Related Service Centers. \\r\\nSummer Related Service Centers provide speech, occupational therapy, and physical therapy \\r\\nservices to students with 12-month related service IEP recommendations. Programmatic information \\r\\nis provided by the Office of Special Education. Funding is subject to change; if sites change, \\r\\nfunding will be recouped.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAllocations for this program will be placed in the following allocation categories:\\n\\nESY Summer Rising Services RS\\n\\n or \\n\\nTL RS ESY Summer Rising Services\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nF. ASD/Nest/Horizon Summer Rising Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ASD summer program provides current program students the opportunity to practice social \\r\\ncommunication and pragmatic skills with ASD trained staff to support development and prevent \\r\\nregression. Students with autism need explicit instruction (teachable moments) in realistic settings, \\r\\nability to build language and communication skills to fully engage and access curriculum, and build \\r\\nflexibility, self-awareness, and understanding of social concepts. Without the continuation of these \\r\\nspecific supports, many students with autism will struggle to integrate back into the classroom and \\r\\nengage in academics in the fall. The ASD summer program provides elementary and middle school students the support of \\r\\nASD trained staff, e.g. teachers, related services providers, and paraprofessionals.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ASD summer program provides skill based support for four-weeks, at four days per week for \\r\\nfour hours per day with intergraded related services through collaboration between summer program \\r\\neducators and related service providers.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nProgrammatic and operational information provided by the Central ASD Programs Team, within the \\r\\nSpecial Education Office (SEO) of the Division of Specialized Instruction and Student Support. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFunds are allocated to the summer ASD programs schools to support the following services as needed: teachers, paraprofessionals, \\r\\nrelated service providers, and OTPS for materials and supplies.  Allocations for elementary schools will be placed in the following allocation category: \\r\\n\\n\\nTL Summer Rising ASD\\n\\n.  Allocations for middle schools will be placed in the following allocation category: \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Summer Rising ASD\\n\\n.  \\r\\nSchools receiving \\n\\nARPA\\n\\n funding must use \\n\\nthe program descriptions described in section A\\n\\n above in order to properly identify services in Galaxy and enable ARPA as a funding recommendation. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nG. Summer Rising Pre-K Special Class Extended School Year (ESY) Program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect preschool programs will run 12-month programming for a determined number of existing preschool Special Classes. \\r\\nThese classes must be approved by NYSED. Only programs approved and funded for 12-month programming will run summer classes in summer 2021. \\r\\nAll programs will operate under the standalone Pre-K Center model under the direction of its Early Childhood Director. \\r\\nThe local Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE) is responsible for placing children with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) that recommend 12-month Special Class (SC) \\r\\nand informing families they will receive 12-month services in the Pre-K Center. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPer session funds are allocated for special education teachers, paraprofessionals, site coordinators, special education coordinators, related services, secretaries, \\r\\nand other administrative support, as well as OTPS for materials, supplies, and family engagement activities. Programmatic information is provided by the Division of Early Childhood Education (DECE).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAllocations for this program will be placed in the following allocation category:\\n\\nTL Summer Rising Pre-K SE\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nH. Summer Rising Discovery Program \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrade 8:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Summer Discovery programs will be held at the eight testing Specialized High Schools in summer 2021. Discovery programs are approximately five to six weeks long and provide opportunities for \\r\\ncertain disadvantaged students who scored within a certain range on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), in fall 2021, to attend a Specialized High School starting September 2021. In summer 2021, Discovery \\r\\nprograms will be held at all eight testing Specialized High Schools.\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn order to qualify for a 2021 Summer Discovery Program, students must meet the following criteria:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudent must be in grade 8.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudent must have expressed a preference on their answer sheet for the particular \\r\\n\\tSpecialized High School for which their score qualifies them. The schools and score ranges \\r\\n\\tare as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bronx High School of Science: Scored 455 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Brooklyn Latin School: Scored 450 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrooklyn Technical High School: Scored 454 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh School for Mathematics, Science and Engineering at City College: Scored 461 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh School of American Studies at Lehman College: Scored 456 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueens High School for the Sciences at York College: Scored 463 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaten Island Technical High School: Scored 452 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStuyvesant High School: Scored 466 to 493\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudent must attend a high-poverty public school or live in a high-poverty area if the \\r\\n\\tstudent attends a non-public school or is home schooled:\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic school students (including district schools and charter schools) must attend a school\\r\\n\\t`\\t    whose Economic Need Index (ENI) is 60% or higher. Read more about the ENI on page 4 of\\r\\n\\t\\t    Diversity in New York City Public Schools.

CTE Summer Enrichment Program (CTE-SEP) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe goal of the CTE-SEP is to \\n\\nprioritize social and emotional wellness for CTE students\\n\\n while providing students with additional time to re-engage in and complete their \\r\\nCTE instruction, lab hours, and work-based learning (WBL) activities so that they may advance within their CTE program in the coming school year. The CTE-SEP also offers \\r\\nseniors graduating in June 2021, or scheduled to graduate by August 2021, the chance to complete any necessary hands-on instructional hours, or prepare for and take technical \\r\\nassessments or certificate exams missed during the 2020-2021 school year for their CTE program of study completion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe CTE-SEP will include programming implemented for CTE students at their home schools. Additionally CTE-SEP will be offered via a CTE Hub model in three schools. CTE Hubs will target the class of 2021 graduates from all five \\r\\nboroughs, and specifically offer technical-skills refreshers, and an opportunity to take industry credentialing exams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds are allocated to implement between 54-150 hours of on-site and a hybrid of remote/in-person CTE instruction/activities delivered by CTE licensed teachers, NYSED-eligible WBL experiences, and \\r\\ncollege and career readiness skills-building, especially for seniors and recent graduates preparing for college in the fall. CTE-SEP instruction and WBL program offerings \\r\\nwill be accessible to and support all CTE learners, including students with disabilities and multilingual learners. Funding supports instructional supplies, software \\r\\napplications, industry-validated technical assessments, and driver\\'s education services for CTE-SEP school sites that have confirmed implementation capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools were selected by submitting an interest form, and priority was given to NYSED-approved programs in sectors that require planning and delivery of in-person hands-on as well as hybrid CTE curriculum,\\r\\ninstruction or lab hours, work-based learning, and related student support and advising in Construction, Transportation, Culinary, Healthcare, Pre-Engineering, Cosmetology/Barbering, and Animal Science. The CTE team will conduct budget check-ins with \\r\\nparticipating schools to ensure spending is aligned with plans submitted as part of the interest form.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools approved to receive WBL Stipends will have those funds managed centrally by OPSR.  Schools should not use funds allocated via this SAM for WBL stipends.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for the CTE-SEP program will be placed in the \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery CTE Summer Rising\\n\\n allocation category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJ. Artist Murals and Pop Up Performance Grants \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn collaboration with the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs and the City Artist Corps, this allocation provides $25,000 per awarded project for murals and performing arts to Summer Rising sites. \\r\\nSummer Rising sites applied in May 2021 for $25,000 of OTPS funding to partner with an arts and cultural organization to bring in 2 visual or performing artists in consultation with school leader \\r\\nand school community to engage students and school community in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncollaborative outdoor mural project in consultation with school leader and school community, and/or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncollaborative outdoor performing arts (dance, music, and/or theater) project(s)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOutdoor celebrations of the murals or pop-up performance to take place at the end of Summer Rising and will comply with all health and social distancing guidelines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgramming will run for the 6 weeks of Summer Rising plus planning meetings prior to the start of Summer Rising.

Work-Based Learning (WBL) Partnership Incubator \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum allocates funding for select high schools to participate in a Work-Based Learning (WBL) Partnership Incubator during summer 2021. The WBL Partnership \\r\\nIncubator program will connect a number of high schools with Community Based Organizations (CBOs) to offer credited or uncredited summer WBL experiences and an attendance and WBL project completion \\r\\nincentive to students. Programming will connect students’ academic recovery needs with the hands-on, work-based learning that will successfully re-engage students, fueling excitement about the return \\r\\nto in-person schooling in the Fall, and will build toward a system that better utilizes students’ education, skills and interests in postsecondary college and career planning.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe WBL Partnership Incubator programming will be implemented July 6 to August 13, 2021. Each participating school will partner with a Community Based Organization (CBO) partner to recruit 25-50 \\r\\nstudents and design, develop, and implement the program during the summer of 2021. This is an opportunity to expand and build off existing WBL programs to reach more students, specifically (1) students \\r\\nwho do not qualify for the Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), (2) did not get accepted into SYEP, and (3) students with NX grades who need summer school support to earn credits towards graduation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following schools were nominated by district leadership to apply to participate in the program: Consortium, Internationals, NYC Outward Bound High Schools and Transfer High Schools. Funding was \\r\\nawarded based on review of applications from these schools on criteria including project design, capacity to implement and integration of learning standards.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding should cover recruitment of a DOE certified teacher for the program via per session. Schools are responsible for per session posting and recruitment. Additionally, funding is made available \\r\\nfor participating schools to procure services of a Community Based Organization (CBO) to support in the development and implementation of WBL programming as direct services to students. Schools must work \\r\\nwith their BCO procurement specialist to ensure standard operating procedures are followed in onboarding CBO/vendor. An overview of the WBL Partnership Incubator, including key program components, school \\r\\nand CBO roles and responsibilities will be provided by the program team.

However, as school year 2020-21 \\r\\nenrollment projections were developed prior to the pandemic, they did not account for the greater than normal enrollment fluctuations most schools experienced. For FY 2021 \\r\\nonly, in recognition of the pandemic-driven enrollment declines, restoration allocations were provided to fully offset funds schools owed for mid-year register adjustments \\r\\nfor larger than projected register loss.

While the US Department of Education (USDE) provides funding based on the number of low-income students between the ages of 5 and 17 according to the census, resources are primarily for supplemental educational services targeted at academically at-risk students.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, the closing of schools, and remote learning, the department is expecting a decrease in expenditures originally reserved for supplemental activities and professional development. As a result, Title I public schools will have a one-time only allocation of carry over funds in addition to the FY 2022 base allocation.  This one-time allocation is to be used in support of the school\\'s comprehensive education plan, is subject to all Title I spending requirements, as well as applicable DOE hiring restrictions, and will not be available in FY 2023. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery Student Succeed Act (ESSA)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965, effective school year 2017-2018.  Allocations of federal dollars must utilize funding methodologies mandated by the reauthorization, which modifies the distribution of Title I funds to public and non-public schools based on eligible low-income students attending Title I attendance zone schools. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease note that all federal funding issued in FY 2022 is preliminary and subject to final allocation by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic School Allocations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTitle I funds are proportionally distributed to public and non-public schools. For public schools, required set-asides include funding for parent and family engagement, students in temporary housing, and neglected students, which are allocated separately to schools. Title I funding, net of these adjustments, is allocated to elementary, middle, and high schools on a per capita basis using the number of eligible children in each borough attending Title I designated schools. Special education classes, provided in compliance with students\\' Individual Education Program (IEP), reduces the need for supplemental Title I services.  As a result, Citywide Special Education Title I resources will be used to enhance supplementary Title I programs in elementary, middle, and high schools in all schools.  This policy has been in effect since FY 1994. District 75 schools, however, will receive a Title I allocation for students in temporary housing. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe preliminary public school Title I county per capitas are:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-Wide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBronx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrooklyn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaten Island\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic School Allocation\\r\\nPer Capita\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$885.90\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$790.97\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$1,117.26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$934.83\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$631.56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$976.34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-Wide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBronx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrooklyn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaten Island\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic School Carry Over Allocation Per Capita\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$108.60\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$103.55\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$128.41\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$129.76\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$69.40\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$103.66\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCity-Wide\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBronx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrooklyn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaten Island\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPublic School STH Allocation Per Capita\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$885.90\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$790.97\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$1,117.26\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$934.83\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$631.56\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$976.34\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe funding borough thresholds are as follows:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYC\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManhattan\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBronx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrooklyn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQueens\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaten Island\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCounty Title I cutoff\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n59.58%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60.00%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n53.20%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFY 2021 Supplemental Carry Over Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition, for FY 2022, schools that are eligible for a Title I allocation will receive a - supplemental carry over allocation, as well as a parent and family engagement carryover allocation, distributed separately via an additional per capita.

In addition, ESSA requires all STH students to be Title I eligible, regardless of the school they attend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn FY 2022, both Title I and non-Title I schools will receive one full Title I, per capita allocation for STH students. The Title I STH Set-Aside for Title I schools is now additive to a school\\'s Title I SWP \\r\\nor TA allocation.  Schools will now receive additional funding to support STH-related services for each Title I student.  As there is not additional Title I funding available, per capitas have slightly\\r\\ndecreased as a result\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funds allocated for these pupils should be used to assist STH children in meeting the State\\'s challenging academic content and academic achievement standards as well \\r\\nas assisting them when they have urgent needs.

In addition to providing challenging content, the school-wide program plan incorporates intensive professional development for staff, and where appropriate, collaboration with community organizations to strengthen the school\\'s program.  Funds are intended to improve academic achievement school-wide so that all students, particularly the lowest achieving students, demonstrate proficiency in the State\\'s academic standards. Schools must apply and be approved to become SWP.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSchools that do not become SWP are considered to be \"Targeted Assistance\" and are subject to more restrictive guidelines.  In these schools, \\r\\n\\n\\nTitle I funds are to be used only for students who are academically at-risk\\n\\n. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConceptual Consolidation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition to coordinating and integrating services, SWP schools may combine most federal, state, and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from federal, state, and local sources, SWP schools may address needs using a pool of all available resources. This gives a school more flexibility to meet the identified needs of its students. Title I SWP schools are able to use Title I, Title I School Improvement 1003(a), Title IIA, and Title III funds for any purpose allowable under the cost factor, as long as they uphold the intent and purpose of each program described in the school Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP). \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving this flexibility is highly advantageous.  While NYCDOE encourages all SWP schools to conceptually consolidate most federal, state and local funding received, the following federal Title funds will not be eligible for consolidation in FY 2021 - 2022:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIDEA, Part B\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle I 1003(g) School Improvement Grants (SIG)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersistently Struggling School Grant\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFederal competitive grants, including Title II, Part B, Title IV, Part B - 21st Century, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle X, Part C: Homeless Education - McKinney Vento\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the required Title I set-asides cannot be consolidated and must be used for the specific intended purposes. These set-asides are as follows: \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle I, Part A: 1% for parent and family engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nA minimum of 1% of a school\\'s allocation of Title I, Part A funds must support parent and family engagement activities and programs.  Chancellor\\'s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams (SLTs) to consult with Title I parent representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds.   Each Title I school must jointly develop a Parent and Family Engagement Policy that describes how the school will carry out the parent and family engagement requirements aligned with student achievement goals, including the development of a school-parent compact in the CEP.  Expenditures made with parent and family engagement funding must align closely with those detailed in the jointly developed Parent and Family Engagement Policy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nDistinct allocation categories are used to identify and monitor the 1% set-aside.  The remaining balance of the Title I entitlement is for instructional services.  Refer to the last page of this memorandum for the list of Title I allocation categories.  The allocation categories are assigned based on a school\\'s Title I status (SWP, TA, STH for Non-Title I, etc.).  Note that parent and family engagement allocation categories cannot be conceptually consolidated.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrior year unspent parent and family engagement funding may be carried over for one fiscal year and distributed proportionately to schools as a parent and family \\r\\nengagement carryover.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nParent and Family Engagement funds and Parent and Family Engagement Carryover funds must be scheduled and expended exclusively for parent education services.

Schools should use the Basic Education Data Survey (BEDS) to identify teachers who need additional certification and take appropriate action to assist the teachers with obtaining the proper certification where needed.  Please refer to Division of Human Resources guidelines for additional information.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nOn-going professional development of all teachers continues to be required and addressed in the school Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNON-PUBLIC SCHOOL (NPS) AND NEGLECTED CHILDREN APPROPRIATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-Public Schools:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nESSA requires the proportional distribution of Title I funds to public and non-public schools based on the low-income student population.  From the NPS Title I proportional share, specific set-asides are required, including parent and family engagement, evaluation, and neglected and homeless pupils. The remaining balance is used for instructional services and professional development.  Instructional services are to be provided to Title I eligible, non-public school students who are low-income and reside in a Title I public school attendance zone.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nRequired NPS set-asides are deducted from the NPS proportional share of Title I funds, which are then divided among each borough\\'s Title I NPS eligible student population to yield the borough\\'s Title I NPS per capita. The measure of poverty for non-public school children is based on free lunch data from SNAP and Medicaid, supplemented with form nominations when unavailable.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFederal law prohibits the targeting of non-public schools for Title I purposes.  Consequently, to identify a non-public school Title I eligible pupil, the following procedure is used:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLow-income non-public school pupils are identified using the same measure as public schools;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe address of a low-income pupil is mapped to a Title I, public school attendance zone for the appropriate age and instructional level;\\r\\n\\n\\nIf the attendance zone is that of a Title I public school, the NPS student is Title I eligible;\\r\\n\\n\\nIf the attendance zone is that of a Non-Title I public school, the NPS student is not Title I eligible.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe public school attendance zones include the Title I schools that meet the established borough poverty cutoff rates.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNeglected Children:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Neglected Children Title I appropriation is calculated by multiplying the local education agency per capita by the respective count of neglected children, as reported by the NYSED.  Neglected Children programs are administered by the Alternative High Schools Programs and allocated separately from this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFS10 Snapshot:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAll Title I, Title IIA, Title III LEP and Immigrant, and Title IV allocations must be scheduled completely in Galaxy by \\n\\n4:00 pm Friday, July 16, 2021\\n\\n, at which time an FS10 snapshot will be taken. Funds that have been scheduled and approved will appear on the city\\'s FS10 financial document and will be submitted along with budget narratives as part of the 2022 Consolidated Application for ESSA-Funded Programs for review and approval by NYSED.   All funds should be scheduled in support of the school CEP.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Title I appropriations do not include increases for collective bargaining, tax levy funds will be provided.

The process is intended to strengthen public input and deepen public engagement in the civic organizations designed to service the public. Often decision-making rests in the hands of leaders identified to represent their constituencies. The PB model supports direct democracy, allowing parents and students to vote for the projects to be funded. PB allows schools to engage students, parents, teachers, and community members in choosing a school program or improvement to fund. The process builds understanding of stakeholder perspectives, directs funds to pressing needs and innovative ideas, and helps students and other community members learn democracy and active citizenship.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPB often follows a defined model that consists of multiple stages:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFirst, the school identifies the amount of money to be set aside for PB.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext, parents, students, and teachers brainstorm ideas and develop proposals on how the money may be spent to improve the school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen, a Steering Committee reviews the proposals and identifies the final proposals that will appear on the school ballot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, the student body and the parents of the school vote on the proposals. The proposal(s) with the most votes are funded.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApproved Alternatives\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nCSI schools have the opportunity to implement any of the approved alternatives to Participatory Budgeting. The alternatives build on essential components of Participatory Budgeting: expanding stakeholder voice, providing opportunities to practice democracy, and promoting civic engagement.  For a current list of approved alternatives refer to: \\r\\n\\n\\nApproved Alternatives for Participatory Budgeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAdditional information, including guidebooks that NYSED developed to support CSI schools with the implementation of their identified Engagement option and outline the parameters that CSI schools must follow, can be found on the NYSED \\r\\n\\n\\nParticipatory Budgeting and Approved Alternatives\\n\\n\\r\\n web page.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFunding will be place in the following Galaxy allocation category: \\r\\n\\n\\nTitle I CSI Participatory Budget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGalaxy Requirements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis funding will not be included in the July 16, 2021 FS10 snapshot and should not be scheduled until after voting is complete, unless the school is engaging in an approved alternative for Participatory Budgeting.

Funding has been gradually reduced for the past few years, and reductions will likely continue in future years.  Title IIA funding is based on a weighted proportion of the LEA students, where the number of low-income students from the ages of 5 to 17 make up 80% of the formula, and the student population from the ages of 5 to 17 make up 20% of the formula.  Funds are also proportionally distributed to public and non-public schools.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFor FY 2022, the department has received a significant reduction in Title IIA funds.  This reduction is primarily due to the state's completion of its Title IIA Corrective Action Plan. As a result, the annual reduction in funding will not be offset by funds allocated from the corrective action plan. Allocations contained in this memorandum are preliminary and subject to change during the year.  Final allocations will be subject to final NYSED allocations to LEAs and congressional authorization.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Title IIA Supplemental allocation gives priority to schools where classes are in excess of 20 pupils and academic performance is poor.  The first priority is to use funds to reduce class size in a grade.  If space is not available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teachers to supplement the instructional program.  Priority must be given to reducing class size in general education settings and must demonstrate the following: \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReduction of class sizes to 15-18 students or fewer (including the use of co-teaching and floating teachers that bring the student to teacher ratio to one teacher per 15-18 students);\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA rigorous curriculum, effective teachers, and a sustained, job-embedded professional development plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease note that all teachers funded by this allocation must have state certification and licensure standards as per ESSA.  Principals have received reports from the Division of Human Capital detailing the status of their current staff.  Schools will budget all teacher positions at their average salary.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuidelines for Calculating Class Size Reduction\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nClasses created through the Federal Title IIA Supplemental program may not include classes that would have been organized absent the program.  The overall total of teachers must be greater than the number of teachers required by the contract.  For example, a school with a grade 1 enrollment of 60 students, under the UFT Collective Bargaining Agreement, would be required to organize two classes.  If the school funds only two grade 1 teachers, no Title IIA Supplemental funds may be used.  The school could fund a third classroom or fund a push-in teacher for the two contractually required classes.  Note that contractual class sizes limits are 25 for kindergarten and 32 for grades 1 through 3.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThere are many situations that could result in different class formations, such as organizing bilingual classes or inclusion classes.  The goal is to maximize services to students while meeting federal requirements.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs evidence of compliance with funding source guidelines, schools must make the following documentation available if requested:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nList of staff funded by the program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClass rosters for all classes in the grade\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvidence funded teachers meet the ESSA definition of highly qualified\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nNOTE: Federal Title IIA funds are provided to increase student academic achievement by improving the quality of teachers and principals.  The program can be carried out in multiple ways including: increasing the number of highly qualified teachers in classrooms (i.e., class size reduction); increasing the number of high quality assistant principals; and increasing teacher and principal effectiveness.  It is the expectation that schools will continue to prioritize use of Title IIA funds to reduce class size and pupil teacher ratio.  In cases where this is not feasible, schools should consult with their BCO team for additional guidance and consideration regarding allowable uses of Title IIA funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSince this allocation works hand-in-hand with \\r\\n\\n\\nSAM No. 13\\n\\n, School Support Supplement, schools should plan for how to best utilize both funding sources to meet their educational goals.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConceptual Consolidation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSchool Wide Project schools may combine most federal, state, and local funds to coordinate and integrate educational services.

All draft plans, including a budget narrative describing the use\\r\\n of these funds, must be completed in the tool by \\n\\nJuly 23, 2021\\n\\n.  BCO ELL staff will review plans and provide feedback,\\r\\n if necessary.  Schools will be notified when their plans are approved and their plans may commence in September 2021. \\n\\n\\r\\nPlans for Title III LEP cover two years; therefore, plans that were approved in the 2020-2021 school year would remain valid for the\\r\\n 2021-2022 school year. Please note, that any significant change to the previously approved Title III LEP plan should be submitted\\r\\n for the approval process.  Schools that did not receive funding in 2020-2021 and, therefore, do not have an approved plan will need to\\r\\n develop a plan for the 2021-2022 school year following the timeline described above; this plan would continue to be in place in 2022-23\\r\\n (pending availability of funding). As a result of this update to the planning cycle, this allocation reflects the full entitlement for \\r\\nthis fiscal year only. Schools should be able, to better manage these resources, to ensure timely service delivery to ELL pupils.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Division of Multilingual Learners (DML) has established the following Title III guidelines:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle III supplemental services for ELLs must include direct\\r\\n instruction and high quality professional development that is \"of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive \\r\\nand lasting impact on teachers\\' performance in classrooms.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional development activities should be well-planned, \\r\\nongoing events rather than one-day or short-term workshops and conferences.  Activities must be used to support language development, English\\r\\n and native language instruction, high academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParent engagement activities are required. Parent supports must \\r\\nensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet community needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need.  Services provided in this program must be supplemental and\\r\\n should complement core bilingual and ENL services required under New York State Education Department Commissioner Regulation CR-154.  \\r\\nDirect supplemental services should be provided through before, after, and Saturday programs.  Teachers providing services must be certified\\r\\n bilingual education and/or ENL teachers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nPriority areas for the use of Title III LEP funds are as follows: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital and print curriculum to supplement learning in response to COVID-19 remote instruction.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtended day programming (e.g., before school, after school, Saturday program) to provide targeted, small-group instruction and credit recovery support. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloping new and/or enhancing supplemental programs for the following:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNewcomers\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE)\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLong-Term ELLs\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImproving teaching and learning in core subject areas, and native language and English teaching and learning, through supplemental professional development activities\\r\\n\\n\\nEnriching parent engagement activities and securing appropriate translation and Interpretation services\\r\\n\\n\\nProviding students with supplemental guidance\\r\\n\\n\\nImplementing strong student supports to increase graduation rates\\r\\n\\n\\nIntegrating ELLs in secondary school reforms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information about development of the Title III school plan and budget narrative, please contact your BCO ML/ELL director.  The submission\\r\\n of an approvable Title III application is necessary to ensure continued Title III funding.

All Title III materials\\r\\n and services must be directly related to activities described in the program narrative.  Purchases should be made, and services provided, in a\\r\\n timely manner, to ensure that the program benefit students requiring supplemental services throughout the entire school year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConceptual Consolidation: School-wide Programs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool-wide Program (SWP) schools that are conceptually consolidating their federal, state, and Fair Student Funding tax levy funds, \\r\\nas described in their 2021-2022 CEPs are not required to develop and submit a separate Title III budget.  However, SWP schools must ensure \\r\\nthat the intent and purposes of Title III are met, and must include in the CEP (in the Title III plan section and/or the action plans) a \\r\\ndescription of the strategies/activities the school will implement to meet the needs of ELLs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram Descriptions: Galaxy Requirements and Timing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds must be fully scheduled at all times.  The budget completion deadline is \\n\\n July 16, 2021\\n\\n (one week before the iPlan narrative submission deadline of July 23, 2021).  Any subsequent \\r\\nmodifications must result in Title III LEP and Immigrant allocations being fully scheduled.  Schools must select a program\\r\\n description in Galaxy to identify how funds are being spent to support ELL students.  As funds are scheduled, schools will\\r\\n need to select one of the activity descriptions in the table below using the \"Program\" dropdown field in Galaxy.  The scheduling\\r\\n of funds must be aligned with schools\\' approved Title III LEP plan contained within the CEP/SCEP/RSCEP. Conceptually consolidated\\r\\n schools that use a different consolidated funding source to fund a LEP program must use the below program descriptions to ensure\\r\\n proper tracking of funds being used to support ELLs.  For example, a conceptually consolidated school using Title I to support an\\r\\n after-school program for ELLs should still choose \"T3 LEP Instruction - After School\" even though they are using Title I funds.  \\r\\nThe total amount of funds identified with the new \"T3\" program descriptions below \\n\\nmust be greater than or equal \\n\\nto the amount of \\r\\nthe Title III allocation for the school.  Schools must fully expend both Title III funds and/or other funding identified as being \\r\\nused to serve LEP pupils in conceptually consolidated allocation categories.  Schools should monitor scheduling and spending information\\r\\n provided in the monthly ELL Data Update Report (EDUR). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle III LEP Program Descriptions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Supplemental ELL Instruction - Before School\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Supplemental ELL Instruction - After School\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Supplemental ELL Instruction - Saturday Program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Supplemental ELL Instruction - Other\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Certified ELL Teachers (ESOL/Bilingual)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Supplemental Guidance/Counseling Services \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Professional Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 LEP Parent Involvement/Engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFS10 Snapshot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll Title I, Title IIA, Title III LEP, and Title IV allocations must be scheduled completely in Galaxy by\\n\\n 4:00 pm Friday, July 16, 2021\\n\\n, \\r\\nat which time an FS10 snapshot will be taken.

Evidence shows that students in temporary housing are significantly more likely to be chronically absent than their stably housed peers. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis initiative will place school-based Community Coordinators in schools to positively impact students who are living in temporary housing. Community Coordinators will support students\\' academic success, social emotional development, and connections to much needed resources.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis additional layer of school based support will (a) build capacity in schools and provide support mechanisms in the field so schools can appropriately serve students in shelter; (b) strengthen school-shelter connections to create a more holistic support model for students and drive attendance improvement; (c) improve outreach and communication with families of STH.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nParticipating schools were selected based on STH student count and existing school resources. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nCommunity Coordinators will connect students and families in temporary housing to resources, and coordinate academic and social service supports. Community Coordinators will support and liaise with a small portfolio of shelter based Family Assistants to ensure strong connections between school and shelter staff. They will also liaise with school based support teams, including the STH liaison, guidance counselors and social workers, and will work with these teams to provide trauma informed supports to students. Community Coordinators will support student transportation needs, and will help organize data analysis and interventions for students and families. Community Coordinators will work in full collaboration with the entire school community and are committed to reducing barriers to academic success for all students in temporary housing. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMost schools will receive funds which can be used only to support one full-time Community Coordinator, who will be responsible for coordinating comprehensive supports for students in temporary housing. Several schools with high STH needs will receive additional positions as noted in the allocation tables. \\r\\nThe Community Coordinator position is an administrative position and the salary covers July and August.  Therefore, the following allocations are being provided:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFor the July-August 2021 summer salary costs, funds are being placed in the \\r\\n\\n\\nRollover Title IV Community Coordinator\\n\\n\\r\\n allocation category.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFor the 2021-2022 school year, allocations will cover the full twelve month salary costs.  Schools will need to schedule the July and August 2022 summer costs in the summer non-professional set aside line (4061), which may appear as an OTPS item in Galaxy.   The allocation is being placed in the \\r\\n\\n\\nTitle IV Community Coordinator allocation\\n\\n category.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAll schools receiving services from a Title IV Community Coordinator are responsible for the following:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMaintaining communication with the STH Regional Manager with respect to hiring and supervising the Community Coordinator as well as the Community Coordinator\\'s caseload, performance (including end-of-year ratings), and any other concerns, including two in-person meetings with the Regional Manager (Fall/Spring);\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPrincipal or designee will attend an STH administrator information session; and\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nEach school will be required to set goals for the Community Coordinator in collaboration with the STH Regional Manager to align the work of the community coordinator with the schools\\' goals identified in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor any questions regarding this allocation, please email \\n\\nsthinfo@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAllocations must be scheduled in the allocation category \\r\\n\\n\\nTitle IV Community Coordinator\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB.

This is a design-thinking program, with four core elements: curriculum, professional development, teacher coaching, and a student showcase. Funds will support the professional growth of colleagues. Funding will also support per session to complete planning, turnkeying, student check-ins, attending/supporting Emoti-Con.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$14,690.46 to fund Mouse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$3,809.54 for per session\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMouse will provide a 3-day virtual professional development training, including synchronous and asynchronous activities for all participating teachers. Teachers will complete hands-on activities from the \\n\\nDesign with Purpose\\n\\n curriculum to learn more about the human centered design process and learn about common pedagogy used in design thinking classrooms. The training will also focus on supporting youth well-being, engagement and differentiation in a remote learning context.  Additional professional development check-ins will be scheduled with all teachers throughout the program.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign League is an in-depth digital design program in which students work in teams to create a new app or website that addresses a social need using the Human-Centered Design process. Students will get hands-on experience in every stage of digital design, from user interviews and research to UX/UI design, prototyping, graphic design, and coding, to branding and pitching their projects.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n71 Schools will receive 6,500 to fund half of the stipend for an Ed Tech Model Teacher. Funding will be used for professional development per session activities and teacher salary additions.  Please note that schools must have teachers who have been entered into the pool of qualified Teacher Leader candidates by the Office of Teacher Leadership and are staffed into these roles to receive the allocation. Allocations should be designated as follow:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$5,000 to split fund Model Teacher stipend for the 21-22 school year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$1,500 for per session which includes 16-18 hours of professional learning (to be scheduled outside of regular school hours and outside of the 2 extra hours a month teachers must work) provided by the Ed Tech Program for the model teachers to complete the requirements for the Google Digital Learning Coach Program and 4 hours to submit coaching artifacts at the end of the school year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis allocation will be added in the allocation category \\n\\nTitle IV ED Tech\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Title IV Ed Tech allocations must be scheduled completely in Galaxy by 4:00 pm Monday, February 28, 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease direct questions to \\n\\nedtechprograms@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConceptual Consolidation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition to coordinating and integrating services, SWP schools may combine most federal, state, and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from federal, state, and local sources, SWP schools may address needs using a pool of all available resources. This gives a school more flexibility to meet the identified needs of its students. Title I SWP schools are able to use Title I, Title I School Improvement 1003(a), Title IIA, Title III, and Title IV funds for any purpose allowable under the cost factor, as long as they uphold the intent and purpose of each program described in the School Comprehensive Education Plan (SCEP).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving this flexibility is highly advantageous.

This allocation is subject to change every three years, as student populations shift across the system.\\r\\n The 3-year review took place in SY 2020-2021. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n This allocation funds 960 IEP/Intervention teachers, over and above other special education teacher allocations and without regard to\\r\\n Teacher of Special Education vacancies that may still exist. All schools must continue to ensure the participation of the student\\'s\\r\\n special education teacher during annual reviews and re-evaluations of students receiving special education services. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n As per the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) collective bargaining agreement for IEP intervention teachers, schools are required to\\r\\n program at least 5 periods of an IEP intervention teacher\\'s weekly schedule (not preparation or professional periods) to prepare for and\\r\\n participate in IEP meetings of students initially referred for special education, and to cover classes of other special education teachers\\r\\n who must attend IEP meetings of their students. In the event that no IEP or coverage work is required, on a given day during this portion\\r\\n of the teacher\\'s schedule, the principal may also direct the teacher to perform prevention and intervention services or other instructional\\r\\n tasks in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA maximum of 5 periods in an IEP intervention teacher\\'s weekly schedule may be programmed, at the discretion of the principal, to provide\\r\\n mandated instruction for students with disabilities (i.e. Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS), integrated co-teaching or special education classes).\\r\\n A minimum of 7 of the remaining instructional periods will be used to provide intervention to students at risk and/or students with disabilities\\r\\n with a focus on research based intervention for students at risk of referral. Subsequently more intensive instruction can be provided to students\\r\\n who have not responded to initial interventions. The Special Education Office (SEO) provides professional development on these interventions to all\\r\\n IEP teachers, and principals are required to make their IEP teacher available for all sessions.\\r\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The remaining periods may be used to participate in pupil personnel, School Implementation Team (SIT) or other child study teams, provide training\\r\\n and support to other teachers on research-based interventions and assessments, and/or receive required training on evidence-based interventions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery school\\'s IEP teacher funding is contingent on the principal hiring a teacher, identifying the teacher in Galaxy, and enrollment for a training\\r\\n cohort by October 1, 2021.  The principal must also make the IEP teacher available for all SEO trainings and ensure the IEP Teacher is delivering\\r\\n instruction and intervention as outlined above, or funding is subject to removal. Questions may be directed to SEO.\\r\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShould schools lose IEP Teacher funding due to closure, consolidation or inability to fulfill the IEP Teacher requirements, the following indicators\\r\\n will be used to identify new schools\\' eligibility to receive the allocation: referral rates, number of students with disabilities, number of students\\r\\n receiving free and reduced-price lunch.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollective bargaining is included in the school average teacher salary amount allocated for each position.

This plan ensures that the student receives appropriate services to \\r\\nsatisfy their needs and education requirements.  Consistent with Department of Education (DOE) procedures and New York State Department of Education regulations, the IEP \\r\\nmust clearly document the need and purpose of any IEP-assigned paraprofessional; the intensity of service required; the ratio of students to staff; and a process for \\r\\nmonitoring student progress.  The determination that a paraprofessional is appropriate for a student must be based upon a documented need identified in the Present Levels \\r\\nof Performance and, where applicable, supported by medical documentation or a Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) and a Behavioral Intervention Plan (BIP).  Questions \\r\\nmay be directed to the Special Education Office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis allocation provides funding for IEP paraprofessionals that are currently scheduled in Galaxy in the following annual title: \\n\\nEd Para - Annual IEP\\n\\n.  \\r\\nFunding will be provided at the school level.  The IEP paraprofessional allocation will be re-evaluated in the fall, based on IEP recommendations occurring \\r\\nthrough the summer and September; students must still be on register at the school in fall in order for the school to receive funding.  IEP recommendations \\r\\nare identified in the dropdown within the Supplementary Aids and Services/Program Modifications/Accommodations section of the IEP. The Office of the First \\r\\nDeputy Chancellor will manage any subsequent funding changes to schools, based on the school\\'s IEP paraprofessional need via the Transfer Utility. Recommendations \\r\\nfor IEP paraprofessional services made outside of the dropdown will not be recognized in the data used to develop this allocation and may cause a delay in a school receiving funding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuidance for funding IEP paraprofessional recommendations for student needs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMandates with durations of 0.8 or greater will be considered full FTEs for funding purposes for one additional year.  The policy is under review and subject to change in the future.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMandates with durations of less than 0.8 will be considered partial FTEs on a pro rata basis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere a student is funded for a \\n\\nfull-time\\n\\n Alternate Placement Paraprofessional (APP) per below, no additional funding will be provided for mandated paraprofessional services, \\r\\n\\t\\twith the exception of transportation paraprofessional mandates, which will be funded in all instances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere a student is funded for a \\n\\npart-time\\n\\n Alternate Placement Paraprofessional (APP), and also has one or more mandated paraprofessional service(s), additional funding will \\r\\n\\t\\tbe provided for the mandated paraprofessional service with the greatest duration.  Separate funding will be provided for transportation paraprofessional mandates in all instances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMandates must be in the Supplementary Aids and Services/ Program Modifications/ Accommodations section (in the dropdown) of a finalized IEP to be eligible for funding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a new student enrolls in a school from outside the NYC Public Schools and has an IEP requiring an IEP paraprofessional, the school should apply for funding from their Borough/Citywide Office (BCO).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a school adds IEP paraprofessional services to a student\\'s IEP during the year, the school will be responsible for the cost for the remainder of the year, unless the service indicated on the \\r\\n\\t\\tIEP as a health paraprofessional\\n\\n. If a student newly arrives at a school during the year with paraprofessional services already recommended on the IEP, then the school should seek funding from their BCO. \\r\\n\\t\\tWhere schools funded paraprofessionals in the prior school year, the school will receive funding for this student in the following school year if the student continues to require paraprofessional \\r\\n\\t\\tservices consistent with applicable policies and procedures. Funding in the prior school year is defined as funding that began prior to 5/1 of that year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the newly added paraprofessional is mandated on the IEP as a Health paraprofessional, and there is medical documentation to support the need, central will fund this Health paraprofessional \\r\\n\\t\\tfrom the point it is initiated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the BCO believes that there is insufficient documentation to support a health paraprofessional recommendation, they will request a review by the district \\n\\nSupervisor of Psychologists\\n\\n.  \\r\\n\\t\\tIf the \\n\\nSupervisor of Psychologists\\n\\n agrees that documentation is not sufficient, he/she will request that the psychologist convene the IEP team to review the recommendation. Funding will be \\r\\n\\t\\tcontingent on the outcome of this reconvene.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a student enters a school requiring a bilingual special education class setting, and the school does not have the appropriate class, funding for an alternate placement paraprofessional \\r\\n\\t\\tmay be requested from their BCO.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a child with an IEP paraprofessional funded with \\n\\nTL RS IEP Para\\n\\n or \\n\\nIDEA RS IEP\\n\\n Para transfers, the funds will be transferred with the child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a child with an IEP paraprofessional funded with the school\\'s own funding transfers, those funds DO NOT travel with the student.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere schools demonstrate they do not have the financial wherewithal to cover costs of new referrals that fall under the school\\'s fiscal responsibility as described above, schools should contact their BCO to discuss \\r\\nwhether an appeal is appropriate.  Appeals will only be considered by the BCO after thorough review of school resources.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuidance for when a recommended bilingual special education program is not being provided:\\n\\n When a student is recommended for a bilingual special education (BSE) program \\r\\n(i.e., a bilingual special class or Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) class; see Guidance on Language of Instruction), the school should work to create a traditional BSE class or a \\r\\nBSE Mixed Group Class (MGC), or to identify a seat at a school with a BSE program. Schools should contact the BSE program team at \\n\\nBSEprogram@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n for support in these areas. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Alternate Placement Paraprofessional (APP) is a paraprofessional who is bilingual in the student\\'s recommended language of instruction. Students recommended for bilingual special education may be eligible for an APP \\r\\nif they are \\n\\nnot\\n\\n:  a) served in an established Bilingual Specialized Program or b) fully served by a teacher with a bilingual extension in their recommended language as evidenced by Program Services (SESIS/STARS linkage) reports. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note: The purpose of an APP is to serve students\\' academic language needs, not their special education needs. An APP is a temporary support until the school is able to fulfill a student\\'s \\r\\nbilingual special class or ICT recommendation or a placement is made in another school providing the recommended bilingual special education program. The school remains out of compliance while the \\r\\nstudent is served by the APP and should be actively seeking to implement the bilingual special class or ICT program recommendation.  However, the APP function may be served by a paraprofessional \\r\\nperforming another function, such as a classroom/programmatic paraprofessional. The APP function may also be served by a student\\'s individual IEP-assigned paraprofessional as long as they would \\r\\nonly be serving that student at that time.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnly one APP is needed for each language for which students in the class require support (e.g., a class may have one APP for 3 students who require instruction in Albanian; and one APP \\r\\nfor 2 students who require instruction in Bengali, as such, the school would receive funding for 2 APP paras and not 5). Schools are expected to schedule APPs as efficiently as possible, based on these rules. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a student requires an APP, the school should use an existing paraprofessional (such as the classroom paraprofessional or the student\\'s individual paraprofessional) whenever possible. \\r\\nIf no such paraprofessional is available, the school can seek funding through the BCO. When the temporary assignment of an APP is determined to be appropriate, funding will be provided for no \\r\\nmore than two school years per student, per school. The first SY of assignment of the APP counts as one full year, regardless of initiation date; funding will continue for no more than one additional school year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter an APP has been funded for the period of up to two years, as described above, where necessary schools can apply for an extension of APP funding for the following year (and for subsequent years thereafter). \\r\\nSchools should reach out to their BCO\\'s Administrator for Special Education (ASE) to begin the application process. The ASE will advise on whether the specific situation will warrant an extension, or if other \\r\\nservice models should be implemented to serve the student. If the extension is warranted, the ASE will support the school in completing the application and submit it to the Special Education Office for consideration.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll paraprofessionals serving in an APP role must attend a series of trainings hosted by the Division of Specialized Instruction and Student Support, the Division of Multilingual Learners, and/or the \\r\\nOffice of the First Deputy Chancellor (B/COs). Principals are required to make APPs available for these trainings and must arrange for alternate coverage. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScheduling Process for IEP Paras in Galaxy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll IEP paraprofessionals were rolled into the same allocation category where they were funded in FY 2021, except where there were missing or invalid attributes on the item in Galaxy.  \\r\\nSuch staff were rolled into Fair Student Funding.  Where a student identification number (NYC ID) was indicated on a paraprofessional, that information was rolled over as well.  \\r\\nWhere students were attached to IEP paraprofessionals with an exception in FY 2021, the student information was \\n\\nnot\\n\\n rolled over in Galaxy.  \\r\\nAll exceptions must be re-evaluated for the new school year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will develop their budgets for submission by the budget completion deadline \\n\\nwith\\n\\n pupil NYC ID numbers.  During the initial budget process, principals must review each paraprofessional \\r\\nin the title \"\\n\\nEd Para - Annual IEP\\n\\n\" funded with \\n\\nTL RS IEP Para\\n\\n or \\n\\nIDEA RS IEP\\n\\n Para dollars to ensure that the paraprofessional will once again serve pupils with IEP needs in the new school year.  \\r\\nThe NYC ID number of the student being served in 2020-2021 should also be reviewed and updated if necessary.  While this information may change, it should be maintained so that it provides \\r\\nas accurate information as possible throughout the year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere paraprofessionals are no longer providing IEP mandated services\\n\\n, they need to have their title updated to \"\\n\\nEd Para - Annual (non-IEP)\\n\\n\", \\r\\nand they should be re-funded with an appropriate funding stream. Principals can easily update titles for paraprofessionals on the Personnel Details job window in Galaxy by selecting the appropriate paraprofessional title in \\r\\n\"Title\" dropdown.  Such staff may create an excessing condition in a school, and the least senior paraprofessional should be excessed, so that they can be placed to work in another school with a student needing an IEP paraprofessional\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSESIS and ATS will be used to verify student recommendations for IEP paraprofessional services and student data.\\n\\n Data for student \\r\\nrecommendations will be sent to Galaxy on a weekly basis and principals should take appropriate action as needed regarding paraprofessional assignments.  Based on updated information each week, the following actions may be needed:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAn IEP paraprofessional vacancy may need to be created, or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaff may need to be reassigned to other pupils, which means that the student NYC ID numbers may need to be updated on one or more paraprofessionals, or\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaff may need to be excessed as noted above.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs student data is refreshed weekly, \\n\\nprincipals must review student status and paraprofessional assignments on an on-going basis throughout the year, and ensure that student progress \\r\\nis appropriately monitored and considered in conjunction with annual and triennial IEP reviews\\n\\n.  To assist schools with this process in Galaxy, the School Management Tool, Infolink, \\r\\nand scheduled items with the yellow \"yield\" icon all highlight actions that need to be addressed, such as when there are students requiring IEP paraprofessional service or when IEP \\r\\nparaprofessionals do not have students assigned to them.\\t\\t  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs schools maintain student associations to paraprofessionals, BCO and central staff will also be alerted to pupil and staff changes.  In this way, BCOs can assist schools and ideally match paraprofessionals to student need, \\r\\nearlier in the school year, enabling for more timely reconciliations and optimal placement of IEP paraprofessionals with students.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere the school has more paraprofessionals than required to meet the needs of their students for the new school year, the \\n\\nleast senior paraprofessionals, \\r\\nregardless of type (IEP or classroom) or funding should be placed in excess\\n\\n by the principal during the initial budget development process, and as needed throughout the school year. \\r\\n(Note:  There are special rules regarding the rights of bilingual paraprofessionals that may be applicable in certain situations. Contact your BCO Human Resource Director for assistance.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nApproved paraprofessional excesses\\n\\n will be funded with the \"\\n\\nTL Interim Excess Para\\n\\n\" allocation category.  In October, or earlier where permitting, \\r\\nBCO Human Resource Directors will match excessed IEP paraprofessionals with student needs, aligned with established vacancies, as per contractual regulations.  At that time paraprofessionals \\r\\nmay be transferred in or out of a school, depending on each school\\'s situation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe table available at the link below provides the allocation amounts per location. Funds for IEP mandated paraprofessionals for students in the merged schools have been combined with the allocations \\r\\nof the prevailing schools.  For schools that have closed, the receiving schools that register these new students will receive funds in accordance with this SAM to fulfill the requirements of the associated mandate(s).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollective bargaining is included in the citywide average paraprofessional salary amount allocated for each position.

Funds must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus \\r\\npandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented \\r\\nstudent subgroups.  In accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the USDOE \\r\\nrefers to as the \"learning loss\". ARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment of School-Based IEP Team Clinicians\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe DOE allocates school-based IEP team clinicians to schools in an annual process known as \"clustering\". Schools\\' projected caseload requirements and their physical proximity \\r\\nto each other are used when assigning a group of schools (known as a \"cluster\") to a psychologist and social worker, funded with this allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that a school may require the services of more than one clinician; in this case, the school will belong to more than one cluster.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne school in each cluster will serve as the payroll location. A clinician and family/clerical worker, assigned to a cluster, is staffed at that location; \\r\\nfunds for these team members are allocated to the payroll location. The responsibilities of schools, designated as payroll locations, are outlined in this memorandum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScope of the School-Based IEP Team Clinician Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClinicians\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool-based IEP team clinicians (psychologists and social workers) provide students with timely assessments of their eligibility and need for special education \\r\\nservices. Clinicians are generally responsible for the evaluation of students referred for a special education evaluation including: conducting psychoeducational assessments, \\r\\nsocial histories, classroom observations, functional behavioral assessments (FBAs) or other appropriate assessments, chairing IEP meetings, drafting IEPs and IEP goals, \\r\\ndeveloping behavior intervention plans, and participating in Manifestation Determination Reviews (MDRs). The top priority, for school-based IEP team members, is to ensure \\r\\nthat IEPs are accurately assessed in a timely manner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily and Clerical Workers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA family or clerical worker is assigned to an IEP team psychologist, to handle the clerical/administrative functions associated with the special education evaluation process. \\r\\nThese functions include scheduling conferences, performing parent outreach, mailing notifications, photocopying, creating student files, coordinating correspondences and \\r\\nperforming data entry. Note that psychologists will assign these individuals work, but are not responsible for training or supervising these titles. Family or clerical \\r\\nworkers work closely with the psychologist, to support all schools within their cluster, and accompanies the psychologist to all locations in the cluster. Psychologists \\r\\nare expected to provide the rating principal with the necessary information to evaluate the performance of their assigned family/clerical worker.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Responsibilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll schools receiving services from a school-based IEP team clinician are responsible for the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsuring each clinician has a private and appropriate space (space exclusively used by the IEP team to conduct assessments and hold conferences)\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nEnsuring each clinician has access to a locked filing cabinet for confidential files and a locked space for testing material.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nEnsuring each clinician has access to office equipment, including a computer workstation with internet access, a copier, shredder, printer, fax machine and telephone.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nProviding basic office supplies.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nProviding the clinician with access to SESIS and other essential systems necessary for managing his/her caseload.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nMaintaining communication with the District Supervisor of Psychologists with respect to the clinician\\'s caseload, performance, and any other concerns.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nEnsuring the timeliness of adoption of new testing materials through the provision of up- to-date standardized, norm referenced measures.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nEnsuring each clinician has access to PPE and adequate space as per the \\n\\nHealth and Safety Guidance\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nEnsuring that all standardized testing material used by SBST team is collected and stored in a locked space at the end of the school year and returned to the assigned clinician at the start of the school year.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nPayroll principals are responsible for the provision of lost testing material and will consult with OSSP as needed, to determine the purchasing need. \\r\\n\\t\\n\\nIn the event that the school psychologist has applied for summer per session, they may sign out testing material on the last day of school and for the purposes of \\r\\n\\t\\tinventory, they must check in material at the start of the school year with the same payroll principal. If the psychologist transfers to another position, they \\r\\n\\t\\tmust make arrangements to return the materials to the corresponding payroll school.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach cluster has a designated \\n\\npayroll location\\n\\n; all clinicians and family/clerical workers in that cluster are staffed and budgeted \\r\\nat this school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipals of payroll locations will support IEP team members in achieving the goal of providing timely evaluations for all schools in the cluster. The cluster\\'s payroll location, \\r\\nwhere IEP team clinicians and family or clerical workers are staffed, is responsible for the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerforming all timekeeping and payroll functions for the clinicians and family/clerical workers.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nCo-rating and evaluating the school psychologist with the District Supervisor of School Psychologist and engaging with other principals, within the cluster.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nRating and evaluating the School social worker and engaging with other principals, within the cluster.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nProviding day-to-day supervision and any necessary professional development to the family worker or clerical staff member.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nMaintaining communication with the psychologist about the family/clerical worker\\'s caseload, performance, and any other concerns.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nMaintaining communication with the District Supervisor of Psychologists with respect to the clinician\\'s caseload, performance, and any other concerns.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nRating the family/clerical worker and engaging with other principals, within the cluster, in evaluating him/her.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote that school-based IEP team members work in the service of all schools in the cluster and not just for their payroll location. Principals may not delegate \\r\\nresponsibilities to members of the school-based IEP team members outside the scope of this allocation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Process for School-Based IEP Team Clinicians\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools designated as the cluster\\'s payroll location will receive funds in the \\n\\nTL SBST Shared\\n\\n, \\r\\n\\n\\nTL SBST Shared D79\\n\\n, \\n\\nIDEA SBST Shared\\n\\n, \\n\\nIDEA SBST Shared D79\\n\\n,\\r\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SBST School Psychologist\\n\\n and \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SBST Family Worker\\n\\n allocation categories.

This memorandum funds costs for new schools opening \\r\\nin FY 2022, schools opened in previous fiscal years that continue to phase-in new grades, and schools with grade reconfigurations.  Programmatic information has been provided \\r\\nby the Office of School Design and Charter Partnerships.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds for start-up costs are provided in two streams:\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFixed per-school allocation for office equipment and office furniture; and\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nVariable allocation for textbooks and supplies.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Schools Opening in FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince the school will need to establish an office, the bulk of the fixed per-school allocation is allocated in the school's first year; small additional per school allocations \\r\\nmay be allocated in later years of growth.  The school will receive $51,000 in start-up funds directly and an additional $29,000 will be contributed centrally towards technology \\r\\ncosts (e.g. phone system, computer, etc.).  New schools opening in new construction sites will receive a reduced start-up allocation of $22,000 as furniture is centrally provided \\r\\nto these schools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA variable per-student allocation will also be allotted to the new school opening this year on the basis of projected register and school type (instructional level and grade span).  \\r\\nA detailed summary of the OTPS start-up allocations is provided in Table 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew Schools Opened Prior to FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll new schools existing prior to FY 2022 will receive a per capita allocation of $100 per student based on projected registers for the newly added grade.  Schools that have \\r\\nstopped phasing in, or have no new grades phasing in this year, will not receive an allocation.  In the case of new transfer high schools, allocations will be based on the difference \\r\\nbetween the prior year's projected register and the current year's projected register, if there is a projected register increase according to the school's educational impact statement.  \\r\\nA detailed summary of the per capita allocations for these schools is displayed in Table 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGrade Reconfigurations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools undergoing grade reconfigurations that were part of the centrally managed restructuring process will receive a per capita allocation of $80 to help offset the cost of \\r\\nmaterials needed to support those new grade(s).

Pre-K and 3-K for All programs provide high-quality early childhood education opportunities that offer all children and families a strong start in school and life. The DOE works with programs and families across the city to support children in developing language, skills, and knowledge of the world.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn 3-K for All, children have unique opportunities for learning that prepare them for future success. Studies show that two years of high-quality preschool improves performance throughout a child's school experience.The path to 3-K for All began in 2017 with the goal of bringing 3-K to every school district in New York City. By the start of the 2021-2022 school year, there will be 3-K for All seats available in all 32 community school districts across the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPre-K for All services are defined as:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull day classes of 6 hours, 20 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18 children served, unless otherwise approved by UFT and the Division of Early Childhood Education (DECE).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n3-K for All services are defined as:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull day classes of 6 hours, 20 minutes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15 children served in each class.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease note that there may be changes to the allocations in this SAM based on enrollment and/or funding appropriation changes. For questions, please contact your Borough/Citywide Office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the DOE, early grade eligibility is based on a child's year of birth. During the 2021-2022 school year, children born in 2018 are eligible to attend 3-K, and children born in 2017 are eligible to attend Pre-K. Children who were born in 2016 are eligible for kindergarten. All children must reside in NYC in order to attend NYC public schools. Seats for all FY 2022 programs will be assigned to students through the Central enrollment process. For more information about the application process please visit \\n\\n https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enroll-grade-by-grade\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools must ensure that a class is full (i.e. 18 students for Pre-K or 15 students for 3-K) before opening additional classes, unless approved by DECE. Schools should not hire staff for classes that have not been opened. Questions and requests for support to confirm class counts can be directed to \\n\\ndistrictprekplanning@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Education Class Enrollment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe local Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE) is responsible for the placement of children, with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs), that recommend Special Class (SC) or Special Class in an Integrated Setting (SCIS). \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs outlined in the City's Executive Budget, New York City is making a substantial investment in 3-K for All and preschool special education. As part of the 3-K for All citywide expansion, the DECE is offering more integrated settings for children with and without disabilities. Over the next three years, the DECE will offer an increasing number of SCIS programs in 3-K. Select programs are eligible to open a 3-K SCIS classroom; only programs approved by the DECE will operate 3-K SCIS classrooms in FY 2022.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe SCIS model serves both students receiving special education services and general education services. As with general education classes, Pre-K SCIS classes have a capacity of 18 children. 3-K SCIS classes have a capacity of 15 children. In a Pre-K SCIS classroom, all special education seats are for children born in 2017 or 2018 with IEPs (these are the only three-year-olds who may be served in a Pre-K classroom). In a 3-K SCIS classroom, all special education seats are for children born in 2018 with IEPs (four-year-olds cannot be served in a 3-K classroom). In a Pre-K SCIS classroom, there are 10 seats for general education children and 8 seats for children with IEPs. In a 3-K SCIS classroom, there are 9 seats for general education children and 6 seats for children with IEPs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSelect programs are eligible to open a bilingual SCIS class or an interim alternate bilingual placement (IABP) class. These classes must be approved by NYSED. These classes are subject to the NYSED requirements for SCIS or IABP classes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions about SC, SCIS, or IABP program guidelines please contact the Special Education Office at \\n\\nspecialedprek@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K and 3-K General Education Model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Pre-K Model serves 18 children in a general education setting, and the 3-K Model serves 15 children in a general education setting in each classroom.

The EFQ describes our shared vision for high quality early childhood programming in New York City. Programs use the EFQ to guide their practice in a way that advances positive outcomes for all children and families. DECE staff use the EFQ as the foundation for the quality supports provided to programs, including on-site support and professional learning. This resource ensures that all DOE early childhood programs, regardless of setting or location, are held accountable to the same standards and are supported to meet the same expectations of quality. The EFQ is comprised of six elements, which are high-level, research-based principles of early childhood quality. Each element identifies several practices, or actions that can be taken by program leadership and teaching teams to demonstrate these principles. The Elements and Practices are applicable to all early childhood age groups and settings. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding Sources\\n\\nPre-K Allocation Categories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Pre-K program is supported by several funding streams:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nState and local tax levy funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContract for Excellence\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nCollective bargaining is included in rates used for each of the components of the Pre-K model.

The DOE works with programs and families across the city to support children in developing language, skills, and knowledge of the world.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn 3-K for All, children have unique opportunities for learning that prepare them for future success. Studies show that two years of high-quality preschool improves performance throughout a child\\'s school experience.The path to 3-K for All began in 2017 with the goal of bringing 3-K to every school district in New York City. By the start of the 2021-2022 school year, there will be 3-K for All seats available in all 32 community school districts across the city.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPre-K Centers serve only 3-K and Pre-K students. Each center has a team of leaders, teachers, and staff. All staff are NYCDOE personnel. Pre-K Centers are located either in standalone facilities or in district school buildings. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K for All services in Pre-K Centers are defined as:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull day classes of 6 hours, 20 minutes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18 children served, unless otherwise approved by UFT and the Division of Early Childhood Education (DECE)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-K for All services in Pre-K Centers are defined as:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull day classes of 6 hours, 20 minutes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15 children served in each class\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPlease note that there may be changes to the allocations in this SAM based on enrollment and/or funding appropriation changes. For questions, please contact your Borough/Citywide Office.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the DOE, early grade eligibility is based on a child\\'s year of birth. During the 2021-2022 school year, children born in 2017 are eligible to attend pre-K, and children born in 2018 are eligible to attend 3-K. Children who were born in 2016 are eligible for kindergarten. All children must reside in NYC to attend NYC public schools. Seats for all FY 2022 programs will be assigned to students through the centralized enrollment process. For more information about the application process please visit \\r\\n\\n\\n https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enroll-grade-by-grade\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPre-K Centers must ensure that a class is full (i.e. has 18 students in Pre-K classrooms or 15 students in 3-K classrooms) before opening additional classes, unless approved by DECE. Schools should not hire staff for classes that have not been opened. Questions and requests for support to confirm class counts can be directed to the email account \\n\\nPKCSupport@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Education Class Enrollment \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe local Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE) is responsible for placement of children with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) that recommend Special Class (SC) or Special Class in an Integrated Setting (SCIS).â€¯CPSEs will reach out to Pre-K Centers to make placement arrangements. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs outlined in the City\\'s Executive Budget, New York City is making a substantial investment in 3-K for All and preschool special education. As part of the 3-K for All citywide expansion, the DECE is offering more integrated settings for children with and without disabilities. Over the next three years, the DECE will offer an increasing number of SCIS programs in 3-K. Select programs are eligible to open a 3-K SCIS classroom; only programs approved by the DECE will operate 3-K SCIS classrooms in FY 2022.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe SCIS model serves both students receiving special education services and general education services. As with general education classes, Pre-K SCIS classes have a capacity of 18 children. 3-K SCIS classes have a capacity of 15 children. In a Pre-K SCIS classroom, all special education seats are for children born in 2017 or 2018 with IEPs (these are the only three-year-olds who may be served in a Pre-K classroom). In a 3-K SCIS classroom, all special education seats are for children born in 2018 with IEPs (four-year-olds cannot be served in a 3-K classroom). In a Pre-K SCIS classroom, there are 10 seats for general education children and 8 seats for children with IEPs. In a 3-K SCIS classroom, there are 9 seats for general education children and 6 seats for children with IEPs.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSelect programs are eligible to open a bilingual SCIS class or an interim alternate bilingual placement (IABP) class. These classes must be approved by NYSED. These classes are subject to the NYSED requirements for SCIS or IABP classes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions about SC or SCIS program guidelines please contact the Special Education Office at \\r\\n\\n\\nspecialedprek@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n.

These classes must be approved by NYSED. Only programs approved and funded for 12-month programming will run summer classes in FY 2022. The local Committee on Preschool Special Education (CPSE) is responsible for placing children with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) that recommend 12-month Special Class (SC) and informing families they will receive 12-month services in the Pre-K Center. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K Center Model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPre-K Centers receive allocations in two parts, instructional and administrative.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructional Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThere are up to seven types of early childhood classes that Pre-K Centers will serve:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K General Education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom paraprofessional\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-K General Education\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom paraprofessional\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Class in an Integrated Setting (SCIS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne special education classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo classroom paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-K Special Class in an Integrated Setting (SCIS)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne special education classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo classroom paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12:1:2 Special Class - serves up to 12 students \\r\\n\\t\\t\\twith IEPs whose needs cannot be met in the general education setting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne special education classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo classroom paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8:1:2 Special Class - serves up to 8 students with \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tIEPs whose needs cannot be met in the general education setting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne special education classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo classroom paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6:1:2 Special Class - serves up to 6 \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstudents with IEPs whose needs cannot be met in the general education setting\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne special education classroom teacher\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo classroom paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funding model for each class model is displayed in the table below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructional Allocation Model for Pre-K and 3-K Classrooms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClass Type\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of Students\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of General Education Teachers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of Special Education Teachers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of Paraprofessionals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbsence Coverage Days per Teacher and Paraprofessional\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShared Planning Hours per Teacher and Paraprofessional\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTPS Allocation per Classroom*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K GE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-K GE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSCIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3-K SCIS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12:1:2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8:1:2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6:1:2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7.5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,650\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*see below for allowable expenses\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor every two Special Classes (including 12:1:2s, 8:1:2s, and 6:1:2s), each Pre-K Center Site will receive one set of Related Service staff, including:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Speech Provider\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Occupational therapist\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne Physical therapist\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, select sites with a concentration of special classes will receive funding for one Special Education Coordinator.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoverage and Additional Allocation per Classroom\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above, each Pre-K Center site receives funding to staff additional teachers and paraprofessionals to support in-classroom coverage.

The EFQ describes our shared vision for high quality early childhood programming in New York City. Programs use the EFQ to guide their practice in a way that advances positive outcomes for all children and families. DECE staff use the EFQ as the foundation for the quality supports provided to programs, including on-site support and professional learning. This resource ensures that all DOE early childhood programs, regardless of setting or location, are held accountable to the same standards and are supported to meet the same expectations of quality. The EFQ is comprised of six elements, which are high-level, research-based principles of early childhood quality. Each element identifies several practices, or actions that can be taken by program leadership and teaching teams to demonstrate these principles. The Elements and Practices are applicable to all early childhood age groups and settings. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding Sources\\n\\nPre-K & 3K Allocation Categories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe pre-kindergarten program is supported by state and local tax levy funds.

These services include but are not limited to Counseling Services, Speech Services, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, providing Assistive Technology, and the provision of 1:1 Education Paraprofessionals where required.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nDistrict 75 utilizes a comprehensive school-based budgeting process that allows all District 75 schools to control their own budgets.  This comprehensive school-based budgeting process has resulted in greater principal autonomy and control over funds.  Each year, the Department has sought to improve its approach to school-based budgeting by making budget allocations to schools more timely, more comprehensive and reflective of the resources required to operate programs that meet the instructional needs of students.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe school budget methodology reflects the distinct aspects of the funding model for District 75.  District 75\\'s school budgets, in contrast to other school budgets, are part of an aggregate district budget that must remain in balance while meeting all mandated needs, school-based and district-wide, throughout the course of the summer and school year.   In FY 2022, the budget methodology will continue to be a zero-based, building block model.  Essentially, all budget allocations to schools are built from the ground up. The formulae are designed to insure sufficient resources for schools to carry out their instructional mandates for special education services while providing the fiscal capacity through which the principal may exercise discretion to meet the broad needs of the school\\'s educational program.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe budget methodology is designed to maximize principal discretion, to the greatest extent possible, in the utilization of allocated resources, while incorporating only those rules deemed essential to effective management of the aggregate budget to achieve the above-stated goal.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM ALLOCATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe \\n\\nTL Instructional Programs CW\\n\\n allocation provides funding to support instruction for students from kindergarten through age 21.  For 2021 - 2022, this allocation funds classroom teachers, classroom paraprofessionals, Crisis Intervention Teachers, classroom coverage and resources to support Assistant Principals as well as a basic school Foundation allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn 2021 - 2022, funds allocated to schools for Instructional Programs will be based upon schools\\' class allocations by program type as contained in the District FileMaker Placement Allocation database as of 04-28-2021.  The amount allocated to schools will reflect changes in pupil enrollment and district average teacher salaries.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT ALLOCATION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe \\n\\nTL Supplemental Instructional Support CW\\n\\n allocation provides funding beyond the basic allocation to support classes. This allocation category will now provide the following funding streams to District 75 schools, which had previously been provided via the TL Instructional Programs CW and/or TL Support Services CW allocation categories:  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOperating Standards\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlex Funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Leadership Teams\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStaff Transportation Reimbursement and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccommodation Paraprofessionals. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn addition, this allocation category will provide school specific resources based on district decisions on district-wide programs or services, as well as \"one time\" allocations as necessary.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe 2021 - 2022 initial allocation will reflect the elimination of any \"one time\" funding received in 2020 - 2021.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBeyond the TL Supplemental Instructional Support CW allocation, District 75 schools receive additional resources based on programmatic allocation or need.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nDescriptions of these allocations follow under the headings of Programmatic Allocations, Needs Based Allocations and Per Capita Allocations.

LYFE operates in 34 high school settings across the five boroughs.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nCo-op Tech: Serves students who are pursuing half-day career and technical training. In addition to the main site in upper Manhattan, Co-op Tech manages smaller \"offsites\" \\r\\n\\t\\tco-located with high schools in all five boroughs. \\r\\n\\t\\n\\nThe Judith Kaye HS: Transfer school operated by D79, located within Co-op Tech, Judith Kaye HS blends academic instruction with career and technical education.  The \\r\\n\\t\\tschool serves, primarily, over-aged and under-credited students in grades 9-12.  Working in collaboration with a community-based partner, Judith Kaye HS provides \\r\\n\\t\\tpaid internships, college/career advisement and robust student support services.  The school also includes a high school equivalency preparation program as an alternate \\r\\n\\t\\tpathway to college and career opportunities. \\r\\n\\t\\n\\nReferral Centers for HS Alternatives: Serves approximately 8,000 students a year as a point of entry to D79 programs and referral source to other DOE schools. All \\r\\n\\t\\tvisitors to a referral center meet individually with a guidance counselor or social worker who reviews transcripts and academic history of students.  Those students \\r\\n\\t\\twishing to enroll in a D79 program, and meet the eligibility criteria, are assessed in reading and mathematics in order to make the most appropriate referral.  \\r\\n\\t\\tThere are six referral centers citywide, all of which are staffed by guidance counselors, social workers and community workers. Staff assigned to Referral Centers \\r\\n\\t\\tare part of the Pathways to Graduation DBN and report to Pathways to Graduation Principals.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult Education Students (21 and over)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult Education Students includes students 21 and over who are seeking classes in Basic Literacy, Mathematics, High School Equivalency Test Preparation, Career and Technical Education \\r\\nand/or English as a Second Language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYoung Adult Borough Centers (YABC)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYoung Adult Borough Centers (YABCs) are afternoon and evening programs designed to meet the educational needs of high school students who are behind in credit and/or have responsibilities \\r\\nthat make it hard to attend school during the day. YABCs are non-diploma-granting programs overseen by District 79. YABCs are supported by the Learning to Work program which offers paid \\r\\ninternships, student support services, in-depth job readiness, and college and career exploration activities. Student enrollment in a YABC program is contingent upon seat availability and \\r\\ncourse offerings at that particular YABC location.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents Served \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two groups of students who are eligible to attend YABCs programs: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents above compulsory age: Students who have completed the school year in which they turn 17 years old and are currently enrolled in high school can transfer to \\r\\n\\t\\ta YABC. These students are transferred to the appropriate YABC DBN and complete their remaining courses and exams required for graduation at the YABC. When these \\r\\n\\t\\tstudents have successfully met all graduation requirements, they receive their high school diploma from their home school. Students above compulsory school age may \\r\\n\\t\\tremain on their home school register to take additional courses at YABC.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nCompulsory age students: Students who have not completed the school year in which they turn 17 years old and are currently enrolled in high school may enroll at a \\r\\n\\t\\tYABC to take additional courses. These students are required to complete 5.5 hours of instruction at their home school. Compulsory age students require parental \\r\\n\\t\\tconsent to enroll at YABCs. \\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunity Based Organization (CBO) Component\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCBO providers complement the academic component of the YABC by providing an array of youth development supports, personal growth and life skills management services for students.  \\r\\nThese include student recruitment, engagement and attendance outreach, counseling, referrals to social services, case management, extracurricular activities, college and career exploration \\r\\nand planning, and employment preparation and assistance with placement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram Staffing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDOE staff is limited to working with students enrolled in the YABC. Funds are to be used to hire a full-time 12 Month Assistant Principal Supervisor (AP), who is hired and supervised by \\r\\nthe YABC principal.  The AP, in consultation with the principal, may hire a full-time guidance counselor, who is supervised by the assistant principal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo principals lead YABC citywide, with one supervising programs in Brooklyn and Queens, and the other supervising programs in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island. Principals generally \\r\\nwork from 1 PM-9 PM Monday-Thursday, with more flexible hours on Fridays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe full-time AP must be scheduled to work from 1 PM to 9 PM except on Fridays when more flexible hours may be set.  Assistant principals must work with the designated CBO partner in a \\r\\ncollaborative fashion to build and maintain a learning environment with high expectations for students and reflective of youth development principles.  The AP is required to participate \\r\\nin regularly scheduled YABC networking meetings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a site chooses to hire a full-time guidance counselor, he/she will work a contractual six hours and 30 minutes exclusive of lunch.  He/she may only serve students enrolled in the YABC.  \\r\\nFull-time guidance counselors will be required to work his/her contractual number of hours per day within the 1 PM and 9 PM school session time of the YABC program as designated by the \\r\\nprincipal and assistant principal of the program.  If support is needed beyond the contractual work day, standard per session rules apply.  Hiring of guidance counselors should occur \\r\\nthrough the Open Market Transfer System (OMTS).  After the OMTS closes ATRs will be available through the Excess Staff Selection System.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll other DOE staff must be per session employees who may only work between the hours of 4 PM and 9 PM, Monday through Friday, weekends, holidays and non-school days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTPS Costs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOTPS expenditures must be for the dedicated use of the YABC program and support the advancement of students enrolled in the YABC program.  All expenditures must adhere to purchasing \\r\\nand procurement guidelines outlined in the Standard Operating Procedures Manual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo meet these varied needs, D79 utilizes a comprehensive program-based budgeting process (similar to that used for DOE schools) that grants all D79 programs autonomy over their budgets. \\r\\nThe allocation methodology reflects the distinct aspects of the funding model for the varied programs in D79, and takes into account the various student populations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn formulating each program\\'s allocation, the district funds the continuation of current initiatives, contractual obligations, and cost models for new initiatives. The superintendent meets \\r\\nwith district stakeholders, including principals and agency partners, to determine district-wide priorities and funding opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipals receive funding in the following allocation categories:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Instructional Programs HS D79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Instructional Programs Adult ED HS D79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL HS Equivalency \\n\\n (formerly TL GED Support LTW)\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nTL ReStart D79 \\n\\n (formerly TL Daytop)\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nTL LYFE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Close to Home \\n\\n (supporting the Passages Program)\\r\\n\\t\\n\\nTL 80 80 Rikers D79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL STEP 79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL CTE Co-op Course D79 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Instructional Program HS YABC \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 35, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nAlternative Programs and Adult & Continuing Education Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: et\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLisa Batson\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

In order to provide equitable access to high school screened arts programs, \\r\\nthe Department of Education initiated a multi-year-long process to review moving a select number of schools toward sequential arts programs aligned with the Regent\\'s Endorsed \\r\\nDiploma in the Arts. Schools were identified based on borough need for expanding existing screened arts programs and the preliminary capacity of the school teams and principals \\r\\nto envision, create and staff rigorous sequential arts programs. School eligibility was determined in conjunction with the Office of Enrollment and based upon schools\\' description \\r\\nof their admission procedures in the Directory of New York City Public High Schools and the Middle School Directories.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is open to all categories in support of the screened arts high school programs. Schools will receive funding for this program under the allocation category \\r\\n\\n\\nTL HS Screened Arts Designation\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBroadway Junior Arts Supplement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis program provides supplemental per session and OTPS funding to support schools participating in the Shubert/MTI Broadway Junior Program. This program brings musical \\r\\ntheater into middle schools that are currently underserved in the arts and provides the training and materials necessary for schools to create and present a production to \\r\\ntheir school communities in spring 2022. First-year schools were selected through an open application process administered by Office of Arts and Special Projects in fall 2021. The second-year schools were selected through an open application process in fall 2020 and have committed to continuing their \\r\\nparticipation in the program through this school year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding must be used to offset per session expenses for Broadway Junior program-related activities that occur during out-of-school time \\r\\n(i.e. rehearsals, teacher professional development workshops, production meetings, etc.). Schools are expected to cover all other associated production expenses and \\r\\nper session hours as outlined in the program application. Schools may not use funding to supplant previously allocated funds or as the sole funding source for this program.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach of the 15 first-year participating schools will receive $5,000 in PS funding. Each of the 12 second -year participating schools will receive $2,500 in PS funding. In addition, schools will receive a $2,500 allocation to cover associated OTPS expenses \\r\\nso they are able to purchase supplies for their programs. Funds are furnished to schools under the allocation categories \\r\\n\\n\\nTL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement, TL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement HS, TL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement CW, \\r\\nTL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement OTPS, TL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement OTPS HS,\\n\\n and \\n\\nTL Broadway Junior Arts Supplement OTPS CW\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease contact Peter Avery, at \\n\\nPAvery@schools.nyc.gov\\n\\n for additional information.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\nArts Partnership Grants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArts Partnership Grants allocate supplemental funding to schools to carry out approved projects supported through two Arts Partnership grant programs:\\r\\n (1) \\n\\nArts for English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities\\n\\n and (2) \\n\\nArts+Family Engagement\\n\\n. The schools included in these partnership grant allocations \\r\\nwere selected through an open application process administered by the Office of Arts & Special Projects in fall 2021. Projects selected for funding are to be \\r\\nimplemented in the winter and spring of the 2021-2022 school year.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum details the funding that selected schools will receive in FY 2022, which must be used to support the specific arts education projects/residencies detailed by \\r\\nschools in their approved grant proposals. Funding may only be used to pay for direct services from each school\\'s approved arts and cultural organization partner \\r\\n(e.g. school-based arts residences, performances, curriculum development and planning, and production of project-related reports). \\r\\nIn addition, each school receives a small per session allocation to support teacher, paraprofessional, parent coordinator, or supervisor hours for such activities as planning, meetings, and curriculum review.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will be expected to cover all other associated project expenses (e.g. additional per session hours, supplies, materials, and project resources not provided by the arts education partners).  \\r\\nSchools may not use funding to supplant previously allocated funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll standard operating procedures and fiscal year deadlines for procurement with tax-levy funds apply. Schools will be required to provide documentation of all expenditures made with this \\r\\nfunding allocation as part of an end-of-year grantee report that will be submitted to the Office of Arts and Special Projects.

Funds must be used to \\r\\nhelp meet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and \\r\\nemotional needs and address needs essential to keeping schools open. CRRSA funds are temporary and must be used for the supplemental purposes detailed in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations funded with these stimulus dollars will have \"CRRSA\" be noted in the allocation category (AC). Cost factors in Galaxy associated with these \\r\\nACs may be limited. Schools are responsible for reviewing SAM documentation and guidance to ensure that funding is used for eligible purposes only as outlined in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible \\r\\nprogramming as soon as possible. CRRSA stimulus funding is temporary, and should not be expected in subsequent school years. Additionally, schools should be \\r\\nmindful of long-term budget sustainability of any new programming supported with stimulus funding. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds cannot be \\r\\nused to hire full-time staff. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, \\r\\nmust be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArts Studio\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis program provides supplemental funding to schools for each full-time assigned teacher of the arts (elementary level) teaching the majority of their classes in the arts, or each full-time, \\r\\ncertified and assigned teacher of the arts (secondary level) on staff,  teaching the majority of their classes in the arts. This funding is provided to offset the purchasing of studio materials \\r\\nto enhance teaching and learning in dance, music, theater, and visual arts.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe program benefits must be used to \\n\\nsupplement\\n\\n present school funding for arts programs. Funds cannot be used as the sole funding source for arts \\r\\nstudio materials or to supplant previously allocated funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive $1,135 per eligible teacher. Eligible teachers meet the following criteria:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor elementary teachers, full-time assigned teachers who teach at least 50% of their assigned STARS classes in the arts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor secondary teachers, full-time assigned teachers who teach at least 50% of their assigned STARS classes in the arts and who hold NYS certification in that arts content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, eligible teachers must be on regular active status. To determine eligible teachers, data on teacher certification and assignments was obtained from the Division of Human Resources \\r\\nas of October 31, 2021. The data on teacher class assignments in STARS was obtained from the Office of Data Management as of October 31, 2021.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds are intended to enhance the quality of culturally-responsive, standards-based, Blueprint-aligned instruction in the arts studio. Therefore, decisions about purchases should be made \\r\\njointly between the principal (or their designee) and each eligible arts teacher. Please be advised that arts teachers will be notified directly when school funds are allocated so that teachers \\r\\nand administrators can work collaboratively on a spending plan.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive funding for this program under the allocation category \\n\\nCRRSA Restoration Arts Studio\\n\\n and \\n\\nCRRSA CRSE Arts Studio\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds can be used to support the following OTPS costs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructional Supplies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducational Software\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEquipment - General (Note: Any audio/visual equipment purchased must be for instructional use in an arts classroom only)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll standard operating procedures and fiscal year deadlines for procurement with tax-levy funds apply. All school expenditures are subject to review. A random-sample audit may be conducted. \\r\\nSelected schools may be asked to provide documentation of all expenditures made with this funding allocation along with a narrative describing how items were selected and how they are \\r\\nbeing used in the arts studio. The results of the audit will influence decisions regarding future school allocations.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease contact the Office of Arts and Special Projects at \\n\\nArtsAndSpecialProjects\\n\\n with the \\r\\nsubject line \"Arts Teacher Studio Funding\" and your DBN along with the file number for the teacher, if you have any questions. Due to the timing of the allocation and the pre-verification from DOE data sources, \\r\\nthe Office of Arts and Special Projects is unable to grant any appeals for this funding.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVirtual Audition School Per Sessions Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis allocation will fund school staff per session, for reviewing virtual audition files and entering rank information in MySchools, for admissions purposes at Mark Twain I.S. 239.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the first year, all auditions will take place virtually. Students will submit audition files through a centralized system. OSE will collect all submitted files and share them with \\r\\nMark Twain I.S. 239 staff, at the end of February. The original deadline for audition schools to enter ranking information in MySchools was March 15.

This funding will expire on August 31, 2021.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn August, additional ARPA stimulus funding was added to support ongoing planning activities. ARPA funding under this \\r\\nSAM will be available for use throughout the school year. These funds are inclusive of remaining accruals from the Summer AP allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn September, the ARPA stimulus allocation was increased to include planning to support asynchronous instruction on Election Day, \\r\\nand for school-based teachers and other mandated related service providers time to share content, engage students and provide instruction during emergency closures.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility and Guidance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs schools navigate these unprecedented times and begin formal preparation for a return to school in the fall, summer provides an opportunity for students to re-engage with \\r\\ntheir school communities, receive supplemental services to mitigate learning loss, and to address students\\' pandemic-related trauma. At the same time, there is increased need \\r\\nfor formal preparation for a return to school in the fall. The need for additional planning may continue throughout the school year as school leaders continue to identify and \\r\\naddress needs within the school community, plan for supplemental services to support academic recovery, and deal with the social and emotional learning needs of our young people. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo provide supplemental resources for the planning process for return to school generally and for use of stimulus funds, this SAM allocates supplemental funding to support the \\r\\nschool opening planning for fall 2021 and support continued planning needs throughout the school year. This may include developing programming to improve access and student engagement \\r\\nfor STEM, foreign language instruction, arts or music education, American history, civics, economics, geography, government education and environmental education, as well as planning \\r\\nmeetings to address the social and emotional needs of students and their families as they return to school after potentially 18 months of remote instruction, addressing dropout prevention, \\r\\nimplementing systems to prevent bullying and harassment, and establishing community partnerships.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStimulus funding allocated under this SAM may also be used for setting up administrative and learning spaces, and to support family outreach in preparation for school opening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle IV Funding\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle IV funds were provided to schools with the initial allocations.

Funds must be used to help \\r\\nmeet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs \\r\\nand address needs essential to keeping schools open. CRRSA funds are temporary and must be used for the supplemental purposes detailed in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations funded with these stimulus dollars will have \"CRRSA\" be noted in the allocation category (AC). Cost factors in Galaxy associated with these ACs may be limited. \\r\\nSchools are responsible for reviewing SAM documentation and guidance to ensure that funding is used for eligible purposes only as outlined in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible programming as \\r\\nsoon as possible. CRRSA stimulus funding is temporary, and should not be expected in subsequent school years. Additionally, schools should be mindful of long-term budget \\r\\nsustainability of any new programming supported with stimulus funding. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds cannot be used to hire full-time staff. As with all \\r\\nfederal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, must be retained on site at the school to \\r\\nsupport expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSituation Room\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive an additional allocation to be used for per session for principals and assistant principals who have administered COVID protocols for actionable cases from Situation Room interactions. \\r\\nThe funding allocated supports five per session hours for each actionable case that was reported to the Situation Room and resulted in a full or partial classroom or school building closure, beginning September 14, 2020. \\r\\nThe allocation for each actionable case should be equitably distributed among the CSA represented employees who performed the Situation Room related work for each particular COVID-related case that triggered the allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding will be placed in school budgets in the allocation categories,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Situation Room\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Situation Room CW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPre-K Center Situation Room\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRRSA Situation Room\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 38, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachments:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nCOVID-19 Planning Supplement Allocation Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2 - \\n\\nCOVID-19 Planning Supplement Allocation Detail \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3 - \\n\\nCOVID-19 Planning Supplement Election Day Remote Planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4 - \\n\\nCOVID-19 Planning Supplement Situation Room Allocation Detail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: ra\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRandy Asher\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t                 \\t\\t\\t     Vicki Bernstein\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t                                 Jose Ruiz \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Funds must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, \\r\\nincluding activities and interventions that respond to student academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented student subgroups.  \\r\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support  academic recovery activities or what the USDOE refers to as the \"learning loss\". \\r\\nARPA funds are temporary and supplemental. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Social Workers in High-Need Schools \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum allocates tax levy funding to continue and federal stimulus funding to expand an FY 2020 initiative for school-based\\r\\n social worker positions in order to provide access to direct mental health supports at schools citywide. The goal of the funding \\r\\nis to ensure that schools, with demonstrated need, receive funding for a full-time school social worker who is able to support students \\r\\nwith their varied social and emotional needs. Social workers funded through this SAM are intended to provide mental health supports at their respective school location.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nResponsibilities:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide targeted supports to individuals and selective services to identified groups;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeliver counseling with an emphasis on supporting mental health;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConduct parent workshops;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake needed referrals for health and professional services and access to public benefits;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide workshops and support to school staff to educate them on mental health matters and students\\' social-emotional needs;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunicate and coordinate with other adults who may be supporting these students; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerform related work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSelection Criteria:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools selected to receive this funding in prior years were chosen from the cohort of schools that lacked direct mental health services\\r\\n and lacked a full-time school social worker in the 2018-2019 school year. Additional selection criteria included the number and rate of behavioral\\r\\n incidents, mental health crises, and NYC School Survey data regarding parent, teacher, and student perception of school environment, specifically\\r\\n those aspects linked to preventing bullying and supporting social-emotional health.  Tax levy funds will continue to fund the FY 2020 cohort at the \\r\\ncity-wide average social worker salary. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor FY 2022, an additional, larger cohort of schools are receiving this funding because they lacked direct mental health services and lacked\\r\\n a full-time school social worker in the 2020-2021 school year. Additional selection criteria include being in a neighborhood or zip code hardest \\r\\nhit by Covid-19 and economic need index (ENI).  For the FY 2022 cohort, ARPA funds for academic recovery (or learning loss) will be allocated at the \\r\\ncity-wide average social worker salary including fringe. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nReporting and Support Structure:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese social workers report directly to the school principal and receive training, coaching and professional development from borough and central offices.\\r\\n Social workers funded through this SAM are expected to participate in scheduled professional development, including meetings, and other professional learning opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFS10 Snapshot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA allocations must be scheduled completely in Galaxy by 4:00 pm Friday, July 16, 2021, at which time an \\r\\nFS10 snapshot will be taken.  Funds that have been scheduled and approved in Galaxy will appear on the city\\'s FS10 financial document and will be \\r\\nsubmitted along with budget narratives for review and approval by NYSED.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe position will be budgeted in the following allocation categories:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Social Worker Support High Need\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Social Worker\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGuidance Counselors in High-Need Schools\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum allocates funding to continue two initiatives that fund school-based guidance counselors. The first initiative began in FY 2016 to \\r\\nsupport high-need schools by funding a guidance counselor to positively impact students\\' academic success, social emotional development, and post-secondary planning.\\r\\nThe 61 schools that were included in FY 2021 are included again in FY 2022. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following selection criteria from FY 2016 was initially used to identify participating schools:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecondary schools serving grades 7-12 that had neither a guidance counselor nor a school social worker during the year prior to selection; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFocus, Priority, Persistently Dangerous or Potentially Persistently Dangerous, and/or Renewal schools that lacked a full-time guidance counselor (less than 1.0 FTE guidance counselor) in the year prior to selection; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPotentially Persistently Dangerous schools with a School Violence Transitional Index exceeding 3.0 that had 1.0 FTE guidance counselor in the year prior to selection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe identified schools are receiving funding to support one full-time guidance counselor or full-time bilingual guidance counselor who will be responsible for delivering a \\r\\ncomprehensive program supporting all students to be effective learners and contributing members of the school community.  The funding may not be used to support any other pedagogical or non-pedagogical positions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool counselors work in collaboration with the entire school community and are committed to the education and whole development\\r\\n of all students.  The school counselor is a key student and staff support services professional.  Services provided by school counselors address the three domains of the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) model:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcademic Planning \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPersonal/Social Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCareer and Post-Secondary Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe position will be budgeted at the guidance counselor average salary, in the allocation categories\\n\\n TL Guidance Support High Need \\n\\n\\r\\nand \\n\\nTL Guidance Support High Need HS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second initiative began in FY 2019 to provide funding for full-time guidance counselor for schools that did not have either a full-time or part-time counselor\\r\\n on their table of organization during the 2018-2019 school year.  The sixteen (16) participating schools from FY 2021 will continue to receive funding in FY 2022 for one\\r\\n full-time position under allocation categories \\n\\nTL Guidance Support\\n\\n and \\n\\nTL Guidance Support HS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBridging the Gap School Social Workers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum allocates tax levy funding to staff one hundred school social workers under the fourth year of the Bridging the Gap Initiative to \\r\\nsupport Students in Temporary Housing (STH). The goal of the funding is to ensure that schools with high numbers of students residing in homeless shelters\\r\\n have access to a school social worker. Services for STH are administered through the Office of Community Schools (OCS). Bridging the Gap social workers are\\r\\n intended to support the specific needs of students and families affected by homelessness. Note that these funds are for providing services and supports to\\r\\n students in temporary housing, and are not meant to supplant IEP-mandated services. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Responsibilities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsuring each social worker has a private and appropriate space for counseling services; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsuring each social worker has access to a locked filing cabinet for confidential files; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsuring each social worker has access to office equipment, including a computer workstation with internet access, a copier, shredder, printer, fax machine and telephone; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding basic office supplies;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaintaining communication with the Regional Manager with respect to hiring and supervising the social worker as well as the social worker\\'s caseload, performance (including end-of-year ratings), and any other concerns, including two in-person meetings with the Regional Manager (Fall/Spring); \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipal or designee will attend an STH administrator professional development session; and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach school will be required to set goals for the Bridging the Gap Social Worker in collaboration with the STH Regional Manager to align the work of the social worker with the schools\\' goals identified in the Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities of Bridging the Gap staff:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide targeted supports to individuals and selective services to identified groups, with a  caseload comprised of students in shelter; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeliver counseling with an emphasis on trauma-focused practices;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConduct workshops for parents;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake needed referrals for health and professional services and access to public benefits;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide workshops and support to school staff to educate them on the issues facing students in shelter and the social-emotional needs of this population; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunicate and coordinate with other adults who may be supporting a family in shelter; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCoordinate with the school-based STH liaison to ensure the basic needs of students in shelters are met; this individual could serve as the school-based STH liaison, a position that is designated in the Consolidated Youth Plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information regarding responsibilities, contact your\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\nSTH Regional Manager\\n\\n. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBridging the Gap funding is primarily based upon the aggregate number of students in a school building, residing in shelters, during the previous school year. \\r\\nThese social workers report directly to the school principal and receive training, coaching and professional development from the Students in Temporary Housing (STH) \\r\\nRegional Manager in the Office of Community Schools. Bridging the Gap social workers are expected to participate in OCS scheduled professional development, including monthly\\r\\n meetings and training events. The social workers work in the schools but they may also assist at shelters to provide services mandated under the federal McKinney-Vento Act. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese positions are scheduled on the assigned school\\'s Table of Organization. Timekeeping records are maintained at the assigned school. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds will be allocated in the \\n\\nTL Bridging the Gap\\n\\n or \\n\\nTL Bridging the Gap CW \\n\\nallocation category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Response Clinicians (SRCs)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis memorandum allocates tax levy funding to support social workers which provide care in times of immediate emotional distress and help students and their families receive long-term care if necessary.  \\r\\nSRCs have been staffed centrally for the past two years; however, for FY 2022, forty-eight SRC positions are being allocated directly to individual schools that have been supported by SRCs but lacked a \\r\\nfull-time school social worker in the 2020-2021 school year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe school-based SRC positions will have the responsibilities listed above under \\n\\nSchool Social Workers in High-Need Schools\\n\\n.  \\r\\nFunds will be allocated in the \\n\\nTL Thrive School Response Clinicians\\n\\n allocation category.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSingle Shepherd\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Single Shepherd initiative began in FY 2016 as part of a series of reforms to achieve excellence and equity across all New York City public schools\\r\\n. For the past six years the program has been centrally staffed. For FY 2022, the program is being restructured so that shepherds will be staffed on school\\r\\n tables of organization and supervised directly by school principals.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe goal of the Single Shepherd initiative remains to pair every middle and high school student in grades 6 â€“ 12 in Districts 7 and 23 with a dedicated \\r\\nguidance counselor or school social worker who will support them through graduation and college enrollment.  This initiative is targeted at two districts\\r\\n who prior to the launch of Single Shepherd had amongst the lowest high school graduation and college attainment rates in the city. In both of these \\r\\ndistricts, academic disparities existed in the early grades as well. At the time of the program launch, Math and ELA proficiency rates in elementary and\\r\\n middle school in both districts were also below the citywide average.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAcademic outcomes in both District 7 and 23 have improved since 2016. Participating schools are expected to maintain fidelity to the single shepherd \\r\\nmodel to continue the successful work under this program.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShepherds support students at a targeted 1:100 ratio and meet with students both one-on-one and in groups to identify needs, provide individualized \\r\\nsupport, and assist them in the development of the social-emotional and academic skills necessary to thrive in their education. Shepherds also provide \\r\\nmandated counseling services to students within their caseload. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Single Shepherd is a counselor or social worker with the skills to listen to, advocate for, and connect students with resources for success in school, and in their future endeavors in college and career. A Shepherd is experienced and skilled to be able to support students in making academic and personal\\r\\n choices. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA qualified Shepherd is a pedagogue who is knowledgeable in:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe NYC DOE high school application process \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncollege exploration, preparation, and the application process\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe impact of societal and environmental challenges\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ninterpersonal dynamics, group processes, problem solving\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsocial-justice and building community partnerships\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe school allocations for FY 2022 follow the shepherd school assignments from FY 2021. Some social workers and all guidance counselor positions are \\r\\nfunded under the allocation category \\n\\n TL Single Shepherd Counseling Services\\n\\n. This funding can be used\\r\\nfor social worker and guidance counselor positions. The remaining shepherds will be allocated in the \\n\\nTL Single Shepherd SW\\r\\n\\n\\nallocation category.  This allocation category is restricted to only school social workers.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 40, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nCounseling Initiatives Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2 - \\n\\nSchool Social Workers in High-Need Schools Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 3 - \\n\\nGuidance Counselor in High-Need Schools Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 4 - \\n\\nBridging the Gap School Social Workers Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 5 - \\n\\nSchool Response Clinicians (SRCs) Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 6 - \\n\\nSingle Shepherd Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: ms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGillian Smith\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Mark Rampersant\\n\\n \\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Nikki Dimanche\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Flavia Puello Perdomo\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Robert J.

Central attendance teacher workload \\r\\nand day to day activities are coordinated by the attendance managers in the Borough/Citywide Office (BCO). The\\r\\n principal of the school where the central attendance teacher is placed on payroll, in collaboration with the\\r\\n other schools where the attendance teacher is assigned and the attendance manager, is responsible for the \\r\\nsupervision of the attendance teacher.

The citywide implementation of AP for All will target improvement on multiple measures of success: enrollment in AP courses, participation in AP exams, \\r\\nand performance on AP exams.  By setting clear college and career readiness expectations, supporting curriculum and professional development, AP for All will significantly increase \\r\\nthe number of students who graduate college and are career ready.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be used to support the staffing of the Master Teacher and/or Peer Collaborative Teacher (PCT) positions, per session/per diem, or OTPS related to this program.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAP for All Master & Peer Collaborative Teacher Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese positions aim to recruit and retain experienced and talented educators, create opportunities for collaboration across the school community, and further develop and refine \\r\\nteacher practice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaster Teachers will teach a maximum of two teaching periods (40% of the time) and are relieved a minimum of three teaching periods per day (60% of the time) to support campus-wide \\r\\nAP for All work.  They will lead professional learning initiatives among schools in the campus community, host visits to their own lab classrooms, facilitate professional development \\r\\nfor AP and Pre-AP teachers, and organize the ongoing work of the AP for All teacher leadership team.  They will use release time, as well as their professional periods, to do the crucial \\r\\nwork of coaching and coordinating and to perform other responsibilities associated with their position.  They will work eight additional hours per month, and eight additional days in the \\r\\nsummer, five of which were scheduled during the week preceding Labor Day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPeer Collaborative Teachers (PCTs) lead professional learning initiatives within the school community by hosting visits to their own lab classrooms, facilitating professional development, \\r\\nand organizing the ongoing work of the AP for All teacher leadership team.  PCTs are relieved of a minimum of one teaching period each day (20% of the time) and will use this time, as well \\r\\nas their professional periods, to enable the crucial work of coaching, coordinating and performing other responsibilities associated with their position.  They also work five additional hours \\r\\nper month and worked five additional summer days, scheduled during the week preceding Labor Day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding will be used for release time and teacher salary additions for the Master Teacher or Peer Collaborative Teacher positions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaster Teachers receive $20,000 and PCTs receive $12,500, as a salary addition, which is included in the teacher leader's semi-monthly paycheck over the course of school year 2021-2022.  \\r\\nPlease note that schools must have teachers who have been entered into the pool of qualified candidates and are staffed into these roles in order to receive the allocation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeacher Leaders will establish lab classrooms to support designing and implementing a student-centered learning environment that affirms racial, linguistic, and cultural identities and \\r\\nfosters positive academic outcomes. Teacher Leaders will use these lab classrooms in coordination with district support to improve the instructional core in AP classes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, in order to support school communities that are furthest from achieving the programmatic goals of AP for All, a small pilot was developed to support non-traditional models \\r\\nof AP courses, such as those present in transfer schools.  Many transfer schools use their existing funding to allow students to reengage and accelerate credits, and offer fewer opportunities \\r\\nfor accelerated college level coursework, such as AP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding will support transfer school communities with building a pipeline to advanced placement courses and provide students with the opportunities to take academically rigorous \\r\\ncourses that will prepare them for college and career success.  To support access, participation and performance in AP, these schools may be eligible to receive funding for AP Teachers, \\r\\nprovided the school meets the criteria of having the ability to offer college-level courses to students who are significantly below the promotional standard as measured by \\r\\n\\n\\nChancellor's Regulation A-501\\n\\n. \\r\\nIn collaboration with superintendents, the AP for All team will identify these transfer school communities that will use this funding to put structures in place to support \\r\\nrigorous college-level courses that will lead to increased college readiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding for this small pilot will be provided to support staffing of AP teachers, Peer Collaborative Teachers or Master Teachers.  In addition to staffing these teachers, funding will \\r\\nbe used for release time and salary additions for the Master Teacher or PCT positions.

Schools should utilize these funds to provide their school \\r\\nstaff with per session and per diem funding to participate in professional learning activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be used to support AP professional development and AP vertical teaming structures:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeachers, in collaboration with school programming and other staff, review class rosters to ensure equitable programming and recruitment practices in AP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeachers engage in cycles of lab classroom inter-visitations in order to share best practices that improve AP student outcomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams assess, revise, and adjust current curricula focusing on gap areas in each content area for classes preceding AP courses.  They make substantive curricular revisions \\r\\nto ensure a logical, sequenced progression of content and skills across grades so that a solid pathway can be built that leads to AP courses, college and career readiness.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeachers on the team implement selected activities/units in their classrooms and analyze ensuing student work to identify where there are instructional gaps, to inform curricular alignment and/or revisions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn collaboration with school administrators, teams assess and revise course sequencing to align to AP course pre-requisites.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams analyze a variety of student performance data to assess current AP preparedness and incorporate those findings to make course sequence and curricular adjustments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams engage in inquiry-driven cycles to look at current student work and assessments to identify skill and content gaps and implement strategic instructional strategies to support students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams evaluate the effectiveness of instructional strategies that have been implemented for developing AP skill progressions, and make necessary curriculum adjustments in order to strengthen the pathway to advanced placement courses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams plan ahead to support the implementation of new AP courses for the next school year including curriculum, assessments, programming, and differentiated supports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds may also be used to directly support AP teachers and AP students by:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConducting extended day sessions for students to prepare for AP classes and the May AP exams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConducting targeted extended day student learning sessions that use formative assessment data to differentiate instructional topics to address student needs before the May AP exams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllowing teachers to attend virtual Saturday Study Sessions to observe and learn best practices, which will then be shared with colleagues.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllowing teachers to participate in AP professional development, during the summer, after school and on Saturdays, to improve pedagogical practices and student achievement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding opportunities for AP students to engage in college readiness experiences and activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProviding opportunities for AP coordinators and related staff to support AP exam registration, administration, and site set-up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools participating in Lead Higher are expected to use the per session funding to support their equity teams and ensure that they have sufficient time to review data provided by AP for All and/or \\r\\nEqual Opportunity Schools (EOS), to review projections for master scheduling, and to develop their strategic plans in order to ensure effective outreach to underrepresented students.  Equity team members \\r\\nwill advocate on behalf of students to ensure that AP-ready students missing from advanced classes have access to these college-level courses.  Following approval from AP for All, schools not participating \\r\\nin Lead Higher may also use per session funding to support the work of equity teams, in collaboration with EOS, to increase participation and improve the performance of underrepresented students in AP.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be scheduled in the allocation category: \\n\\nTL E&E AP for All PSPD HS\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCourse Supplies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe AP for All team will work with assigned schools to develop and implement effective spending plans that meet the unique programmatic and fiscal needs of each school.

The accompanying \\r\\nwellness check will ensure that we are providing a welcoming and safe school environment when students enter our schools for the special administration \\r\\nof the NYSITELL. A majority of these students have not entered one of our school buildings in over a year and it will be critical for this experience \\r\\nto be a positive one in which time has been built in to check on their wellness.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility and Planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is strongly recommended that schools administer the exam to eligible students to ensure that they have the most up to date and accurate measure \\r\\nof a student\\'s English language proficiency, thereby ensuring they serve these students with the appropriate English as a New Language (ENL) and/ \\r\\nor bilingual education instruction in SY 2021-2022.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools with 30 or more ELLs who were remote only during the NYSESLAT 2021 administration will receive funding. Funding will support the special \\r\\nadministration and wellness checks for 50% of eligible ELLs, who include only those that were fully remote during the NYSESLAT administration period \\r\\nand did not participate in the Spring 2021 NYSESLAT exam, to be completed outside of regular school hours (i.e., prior to the start of the school \\r\\nyear in September and/or before school, after school, and/or Saturdays once schools begins).  Note: It is strongly recommended that schools plan \\r\\nto complete the NYSITELL Special Administration for the remaining eligible students during regular school hours in September once school commences.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools should also plan to conduct wellness checks for students as part of this activity. An additional thirty minutes has been allocated \\r\\nfor the wellness check to be conducted for this activity. This component should precede NYSITELL administration for each student during the \\r\\nNYSITELL Special Administration and during summer administration. A \\n\\nWellness Check for Multilingual Learners Guide\\n\\n and translations are also \\r\\nnow available on the \\n\\nInfoHub\\n\\n. This guide includes a structure and questions for one-on-one chats to build connections with students and families. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology and Scheduling Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools with 30 or more current ELLs will receive funding to support the special administration for ELLs who were fully remote during the \\r\\nNYSESLAT administration period and did not participate in the Spring 2021 NYSESLAT exam. The allocation will support with the administration \\r\\nand wellness check for 50% of the students who are eligible to be completed outside of regular school hours (i.e., prior to the start of the \\r\\nschool year in September and/or before school, after school, and/ or Saturdays once schools begins).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools may distribute this funding across OTPS and PDPS expenses as needed, per the following guidelines:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n80% per session costs to support teachers with the exam administration and wellness checks.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10-20% per sessions costs to support assistant principals, school secretaries, and/or school aides with the exam administration oversight and organization.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarginal OTPS costs for assessment materials, including printing, duplication costs and writing materials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer Session Parameters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools must post locally for the per session hours required for the NYSITELL Special Administration, per the following parameters:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTeacher Per Session\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility: Any teacher(s) eligible to conduct the NYSITELL examination, per \\n\\nNYSED Guide to the NYSITELL\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\t\\tQualified personnel that may administer the NYSITELL should be teachers able to carry out standard examination procedures and \\r\\n\\t\\tshould have special training in administering the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT and may include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYS certified English to Speakers of Other Languages or Bilingual Education teachers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYS certified teachers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYS certified teachers who have been trained in cultural competency, language development, and the needs of English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLs)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApproximately 1.5 hours total per student (note: this will vary per student; and may also vary if sections of the NYSITELL are administered in groups):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 hour per student for NYSITELL administration, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30 minutes per student for wellness checks per the \\n\\nWellness Check for Multilingual Learners Administration Guide\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdministrative Support Per Session:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility: School supervisor (e.g. assistant principals), school secretaries, and/or school aides.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuties: Support teachers with exam administration oversight and organization.

Funds must be used to help meet a \\r\\nwide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs and address \\r\\nneeds essential to keeping schools open. CRRSA funds are temporary and must be used for the supplemental purposes detailed in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations funded with these stimulus dollars will have \"CRRSA\" be noted in the allocation category (AC). Cost factors in Galaxy associated with these ACs may be limited. \\r\\nSchools are responsible for reviewing SAM documentation and guidance to ensure that funding is used for eligible purposes only as outlined in this SAM.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible programming as soon as possible. \\r\\nCRRSA stimulus funding is temporary, and should not be expected in subsequent school years. Additionally, schools should be mindful of long-term budget sustainability of any new programming \\r\\nsupported with stimulus funding. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds cannot be used to hire full-time staff. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring \\r\\nand audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, must be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPCS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn previous years, schools may have selected either \\n\\nAgilant Solutions, Inc.\\n\\n or \\n\\nNTT Data\\n\\n as the vendor to support and maintain their covered \\r\\ndesktop computers, laptops, servers and printers.  Both NTT and Agilant have been serving and servicing the schools through Personal Computing \\r\\nServices (PCS) for the last twelve years and schools generally do not change their vendor from year to year.  To help ensure schools can get \\r\\ntheir devices as quickly as possible, as well as to reduce the number of actions schools need to take at the start of the school year, the \\r\\nPCS Vendors and plans will again be assigned to the schools based on last year\\'s PCS selections.  No changes from last year\\'s selection will be made.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPCS generally covers all of the \"core hardware\" that is located at the schools, which consists of desktops, laptops, servers, and printers.  \\r\\nNew for this year are school purchased iPad\\'s that were purchased within the last three years, with additional AppleCare coverage, will now be covered by the PCS vendors. \\r\\nFor all centrally purchased COVID-19 iPads, the service costs are covered by Central at no cost to the schools.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are some exceptions that will not be covered, such as:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNetbooks, inkjet printers, Apple iPads not covered by an extended AppleCare coverage, Chromebooks purchased prior to \\r\\n\\t\\tOctober 2014, Android Tablets and other similar devices that came with a 1-year and/or Mail-In OEM Warranty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAny other non-core hardware like network switches, copiers, fax machines, non-DIIT/DOE approved hardware and printers, or any other similar device.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssets that are over 5 years old are not covered under the PCS plan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs it was for the last two years, schools will be assigned the PCS plan at the \"Standard\" level of service. This is so that all schools receive the \\r\\nfull functionality and useful life of their computer equipment, as well as receiving the delivery and installation services that the PCS vendors \\r\\ninclude under the Standard plan. These services will support Smart Schools Bond Act (SSBA) allocations, which began last School Year and is rolling out to all schools over the next few years.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year again, both PCS vendors kept their pricing the same, and are at equal levels for their Standard service plans. As a result, schools will be able to receive the \\r\\nStandard plan without having to provide any additional funds from other budget sources to cover the costs. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStandard Plan:\\n\\n  The Standard Plan includes In-Warranty Hardware Repair, Out-of-Warranty Hardware Repair (on equipment up to 5 years old), Third Party Coordination of \\r\\nHardware Delivery, Hardware Installation and Integration, Asset Management, and Hardware Disposal/Retirement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipals will not have to go through the FAMIS Portal, as this year, the PCS vendor and plan will be assigned for them. Funds will be encumbered from the school\\'s budget, \\r\\nfrom the Computer Maintenance Allocation and a purchase order will be sent to the vendor that the school selected last year.  All selections will be assigned, prior to the start of school opening.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe allocation for PCS is based on the amount of covered core hardware assets at each school site, as recorded in the DOE Asset Management Database as of FY 2020, at a certain dollar amount per asset type.  \\r\\nFor each covered desktop, laptop, printer and server, $23.00 is allocated. For each covered iPad, $6.00 is allocated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe table below summarizes the distribution method.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesktop\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLaptop\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCovered IPads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of Assets as of FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n81,697\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n623,019\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n34,229\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n65,428\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation per asset\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$23.00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$23.00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$23.00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$23.00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$6.00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$1,879,031\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$14,329,437\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$787,267\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$392,568\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestions may be directed to the Division of Instructional and Information Technology at \\n\\nPCSQuestions@schools.nyc.gov.\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe allocations will be placed in Galaxy in the following allocation categories:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Computer Maintenance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Computer Maintenance HS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL Computer Maintenance CW\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCRRSA Computer Maintenance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Computer Maintenance Allocation will be auto-scheduled into object code \\n\\n613\\n\\n on each school\\'s Table of Organization in Galaxy.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 54, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nComputer Maintenance School Allocation Summary \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: df\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChristopher Martino\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Lauren Siciliano\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Needs for the spring semester\\r\\nwill be reviewed and reassessed accordingly.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSchools should continue to submit substitute teacher nominations in Galaxy for per diem substitutes.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIf schools would like to use this funding for a regular substitute (un-appointed teacher) or permanent \\r\\nhire, principals should contact their BCO Finance and Human Resources Director. Schools making \\r\\npermanent hires must not have excessed any staff this year and must be able to demonstrate an ability to pay for staff next year. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding Resources\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSchool budgets will be evaluated to ensure that schools have sufficiently prioritized staffing for student needs. \\r\\nIn instances where schools are deemed to have sufficient on-site staff, including ATR staff which have been \\r\\ndeployed but are not on school Tables of Organization, this allocation may be recouped in part or in full at a point in the future.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs always, schools should maximize their existing school budget resources to support immediate staffing, \\r\\nper session, per diem substitute, F-status service, prep period coverage, sixth period shortage, school\\r\\naides for lunch coverage, and pro rata for credit bearing classes in high schools. Schools with available\\r\\nCOVID-19 Planning Supplement resources (\\n\\nSAM \\r\\nNo. 38\\n\\n) may also utilize those funds to meet reopening staffing needs. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFunding will be placed in schools’ budgets in the following allocation category:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA COVID Staffing Support\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n Download a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 57, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n    Attachment:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTable 1 – ARPA School COVID-19 Staffing Supplement Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n    LO:bjs \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Vicki Bernstein\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      Randy Asher\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      Jose Ruiz\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

Funds must be used to help \\r\\nmeet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs \\r\\nand address needs essential to keeping schools open. CRRSA funds are temporary and must be used for the supplemental purposes detailed in this SAM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocations funded with these stimulus dollars will have \"CRRSA\" be noted in the allocation category (AC). Cost factors in Galaxy associated with these ACs may be limited. \\r\\nSchools are responsible for reviewing SAM documentation and guidance to ensure that funding is used for eligible purposes only as outlined in this SAM.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible programming as \\r\\nsoon as possible. CRRSA stimulus funding is temporary, and should not be expected in subsequent school years. Additionally, schools should be mindful of long-term \\r\\nbudget sustainability of any new programming supported with stimulus funding. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds cannot be used to hire full-time staff. \\r\\nAs with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, must be retained on site at \\r\\nthe school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding allocation will allow schools to purchase 21st Century classroom libraries with print and digital texts that are \\r\\nreflective of the racial, cultural, and linguistic diversity of their students. For many students, the transition to blended and remote\\r\\n learning due to the COVID 19 pandemic meant they had less access to the text-rich environments of their schools but did spend more time\\r\\n learning from people in their home. Resources in the home language can help sustain the bridge that has been created with family members\\r\\n who are key educators for students. Promoting texts that represent the racial, cultural, and linguistic identity of students is a way to\\r\\n affirm their identity and builds connections and trust with family members that may speak more than one language. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility and Planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the 2021-2022 Instructional Priorities, academic priorities include Providing Greater Support for our Multilingual Learners and their\\r\\n Families. Multilingual learners (MLs) and immigrant families are valued and supported at DOE. We will provide culturally responsive supports\\r\\n that give students and their families equitable access to resources and opportunities that help students succeed inside and outside the classroom.\\r\\n  \\n\\n\\r\\nThe Culturally Responsive Home Language Libraries initiative provides resources to schools purchase culturally responsive home language libraries. \\r\\nHome language instruction is a required component of all bilingual education programs, and home language supports are a required component of English\\r\\n as a New Language (ENL) programs as per Commissioner’s Regulations (CR) Part 154. A culturally responsive and sustained education for student must be\\r\\n full of culturally affirming texts, and rich in texts in students’ home languages. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nEligible schools for this allocation meet one or more of the following criteria:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServed students in a bilingual education program during school year \\r\\n2020-21; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTemporarily closed a bilingual education program in school year \\r\\n2020-21 and will reopen it in school year 2021-22; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHave an approved application for opening a bilingual education\\r\\n program in school year 2021-22; or \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWere reported to NYSED in school year 2020-21 as meeting the\\r\\n threshold in specific grades/grade bands for a bilingual education program in a low incidence language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecipient schools may use these funds to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurchase culturally responsive print and digital texts to establish robust home language libraries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrint and/or distribute culturally responsive texts among the school community. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology and Scheduling Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool allocations were determined as follows:  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools with new bilingual programs are allocated $10,000 per school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n80% of the remaining allocation is distributed to schools that served students in a bilingual education program during\\r\\n SY 2020-21 and those schools that temporarily closed a bilingual education program in SY 2020-21 and will reopen it in SY 2021-22.\\r\\n The maximum per school is $10,000 and the minimum is $1,000. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe remaining 20% is distributed to schools that were reported to NYSED in 2020-21 as meeting the threshold in specific \\r\\ngrades/grade bands for a bilingual education program in a low incidence language.

Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006 (Perkins IV or VATEA). Perkins V (formerly VATEA) funds provide supplemental \\r\\nfunding to address areas in need of improvement in secondary NYSED-approved CTE programs of study as determined by the newly required Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA).\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh quality CTE programs integrate with a rigorous academic curriculum to ensure that students have the knowledge and competencies to succeed in college and/or careers. \\r\\nPerkins V (formerly VATEA) funding is based on the \\n\\nCTE Perkins Grant\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese funds supplement Department of Education tax levy instructional funding as outlined in \\n\\nSchool Allocation Memorandum No. 3\\n\\n:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe distribution of Perkins V funds to schools is guided by a formula that is based on the following:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNewly approved Off Year CLNA programs will receive a fixed allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNumber of students enrolled in an eligible NYSED-approved CTE program that was evaluated as part of the Comprehensive Local Needs Assessment (CLNA) \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tand that had approved status by December 21, 2020 with additional weight given as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerkins V Funding is prioritized for Schools that have an Economic Need Index of 80 % or more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRepresentation of special populations in comparison of a program to the portfolio of programs for the purposes of the CLNA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Perkins V allocation is based on school/program eligibility as outlined in the \\n\\nPerkins V Application Guidelines\\n\\n, \\r\\nongoing accountability for expected student and program outcomes, and mandated requirements of the law. Continuing eligibility will be determined by programs ability to maintain NYSED approval/re-approval. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll schools are required to update and maintain their data in the STARS reporting system and spend their funds according to the requirements as stipulated in this SAM. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequired CTE Program Coding in STARS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThroughout the school year, schools will be required to enter, maintain, and update data within the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager. All CTE program course sequences must clearly be defined, \\r\\naligned to NYSED program approval forms, and submitted in the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager by October 29, of the 2021-2022 school year. This includes all necessary adjustments to approved CTE \\r\\nsequences in the STARS Admin CTE Program Manager, including course code changes, which have to be reviewed and approved by the CTE Program Quality Team prior to approval of a new or revised CTE sequence. \\r\\nStudents MUST be enrolled in an approved CTE sequence when the student/school declares the students\\' intent to complete the CTE program, but no later than November 12, 2021.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudents also need to be scheduled for the courses that comprise the approved CTE sequence in which they are enrolled. This includes relevant CTE Technical Assessment(s) within approved sequence(s) \\r\\n(also included in the school\\'s Program Master). Schools are required to schedule students in addition to assigning CTE assessments to program-sequences in STARS Admin. Failure to gain CTE sequence approval \\r\\nin STARS, enroll students in approved CTE sequences and technical assessments in the STARS Program Manager, and/or schedule students in the classes that comprise their enrolled CTE sequences, will lead to funding loss.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools are now required to schedule and confirm CTE Final Exam scores using STARS and the ATS EVER function. Schools will use the EVER report to identify all of their students that have taken and passed \\r\\nall three components of the CTE Technical assessments (i.e., written, practical, school-based project/portfolio). Failure to submit this data will lead to funding loss. Further information on this process \\r\\nmay be found at the \\n\\nSTARS Wiki CTE Homepage\\n\\n. If schools do not submit this data they will be out of \\r\\ncompliance which can lead to Perkins V funding reductions.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe OPSR-CTE team will work with assigned schools to develop and implement effective spending plans that meet the unique programmatic and fiscal needs of each school. In an effort to provide \\r\\neffective fiscal oversight, programs should anticipate that the CTE team will be conducting quarterly expenditure reviews to ensure that funding is being used for the stated purposes and is on \\r\\ntarget for 100% utilization. Grantees that do not follow allowable fund use may be subject to suspension or rescission of grant funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Allocations\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPerkins V allocations are a result of schools\\' supplemental integrated application based on the 2021-2022 application guidelines. Table 1 outlines individual schools FY 2022 Perkins \\r\\nallocations that were generated based on the schools\\' application and the 2021-2022 allocation plan developed by the OSPR-CTE Unit. Schools and Borough/Citywide Offices (BCO) will receive \\r\\ntheir school-specific budget applications in a separate document sent by the OPSR-CTE Unit. These are to guide the scheduling of items in Galaxy and the use of the funds.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiscal Management and Budget Modifications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll scheduling and spending of the allocation must be aligned with the program application and budget submitted for the 2021-2022 school year.

These remote activities \\r\\nare allowable pursuant to the Chancellor\\'s Regulation C-175 and based on Chancellor\\'s Policy for 2021-22 school year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). Funds must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, \\r\\nincluding activities and interventions that respond to students\\' academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented student subgroups. \\r\\nARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA for Academic Recovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the United States Department of Education (USDE) \\r\\nrefers to as \\n\\nacademic impact of lost instructional time\\n\\n.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nThe activities designated in this SAM are intended to meet this requirement, and these funds must be spent in accordance with the parameters outlined below.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible programming as soon as possible. As this is a temporary fund source, these funds \\r\\ncannot be used to hire full-time staff.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, must be retained on site at the school to support \\r\\nexpenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith the objective of targeted acceleration of student achievement during the continuing pandemic, schools should use this allocation to target academic achievement for all students.  \\r\\nThis begins with a focus on improving core instruction by providing every student with rich instruction in all disciplines and enrichment. In order to accelerate, all students must have \\r\\naccess to enrichment - especially in the arts - as a vehicle for drawing out untapped talent and expression that create the necessary conditions for academic success. Strong, culturally responsive \\r\\ncore instruction is the key to academic recovery and can be supported by the strategic implementation of evidence-based interventions matched to students\\' social, emotional, and academic \\r\\nneeds in cases where more supports are needed to access rigorous grade level content. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools should pay particular attention to vulnerable populations such as students with disabilities, multilingual learners, students in temporary housing, and students in foster \\r\\ncare when strengthening core instruction through an enrichment focus and complementing this with the intentional use of interventions.    \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools must prioritize identifying literacy staff, ensuring multilingual learner recovery work, and using 20% of the funding allocated for arts instruction. Schools are urged to \\r\\nconsider how to leverage Fair Student Funding to ensure necessary staff such as certified arts teachers, ENL/bilingual teachers, reading/intervention teachers, and school librarians work in \\r\\nconcert with programs funded by this SAM to expand capacity, enrichment, access, and support to every student.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Academic Recovery Plan outlines the Academic Priorities for SY 2021-2022, driven by the need to welcome every student, staff member, and family back in this year of homecoming.  \\r\\nWe have the opportunity to transform the student experience by ensuring our school environments are welcoming and affirming, anchored in setting high expectations and rigorous instruction \\r\\nto accelerate learning for every student beyond the pandemic.  In particular, ensuring every student develops comprehensive literacy skills at every grade level is both paramount to \\r\\nacademic acceleration and a fundamental civil right. Building off our strong foundation of 3K, PK, and ULit coaching investments, we are positioned to not only ensure every student \\r\\nhas the support and resources needed to read at grade level by the end of second grade, but also to provide robust discipline-based literacies in all content areas.  As a citywide \\r\\npriority and effort, we will be able to analyze and progress monitor literacy data to ensure our investments have impact in moving students to proficiency, and ensure necessary supports \\r\\nare available from B/COs and Central where needed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith a goal to maximize equity, the methodology is based on projected K-12 enrollment with additional weights to target schools that serve high proportions of students in foster care, \\r\\nstudents in shelter, students in temporary housing (STH), students who are English Language Learners (ELL), newcomer and long-term ELLs, students with interrupted/inconsistent formal \\r\\neducation (SIFE), students with disabilities (SWD), and students with economic need (ENI). The methodology also targets schools in zip codes that have been hit hardest by COVID-19.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools first receive a weight of 1 for each student in grades K-12 projected to attend their schools, and then receive additional funding for students in the above categories at \\r\\nvariable weights. Schools serving K-2 students also receive additional funding specifically for K-2 students with economic need, also at a variable weight. These weights are different \\r\\nat each school and are based on the concentrations of needs found at each school. For example, a school with 55% students with economic need and 36% English Language Learners will \\r\\nreceive an additional weight of 1.55 for each student with economic need, and 1.36 for each English Language Learner.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on these parameters, District 79 Alternative Schools and Programs were entitled to $3.9M. Due to the different types of programs in District 79, and their distinct structures and \\r\\nneeds, the Superintendent modified the allocation methodology for their programs to account for the characteristics of their students, such as incarcerated youth and programs with large \\r\\nnumbers of over-age under-credited pupils.  These changes will also enable funding to be distributed in a way that helps address breakage due their programs being multi-sited.   Allocation \\r\\namounts reflect this update.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe $350 million is then allocated evenly per weighted capita; however, schools will receive a minimum of $75,000 and no school will receive more than $600,000. The allocation methodology \\r\\nonly applies to K-12 students and is the same for all schools. Twenty percent of the funding ($70 million) is allocated for arts programming as described above.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram Descriptions Required in Galaxy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe appropriate program description must be selected in the program field dropdown in Galaxy as noted below to identify how funds that are being spent to make up for academic recovery. \\r\\nSchools should select the program description from the list available and not type the descriptions in directly. ARPA Academic Recovery funding will not be displayed as a funding \\r\\nrecommendation in Galaxy unless one of the program descriptions is used to describe the item. The ARPA Academic Recovery and ARPA Academic Recovery Arts allocations each have their \\r\\nown set of allowable program dropdown descriptions, as noted in the tables below.  \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery - Required Activities for All Schools\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow is the \\n\\nlist of required activities\\n\\n for these funds\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategory/Galaxy Program Description\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllowable Cost Factors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA ARSY Literacy Lead Work\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvery school must identify a literacy lead or team to support literacy instruction across all grades by leveraging assessment \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tinformation to strengthen strong core instruction and intentionally organize interventions as needed.  While schools can select \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tfrom current staff focused on this work during the school day, like Universal Literacy Coaches (ULit) for grades K-2, or other identified \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tLiteracy Coaches; these funds should be used to pay per session to ULit coaches, Literacy Coaches, teachers or administrators.

Funds provided through ARPA must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from \\r\\nthe coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students' academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on \\r\\nunderrepresented student subgroups. ARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the United States Department of \\r\\nEducation (USDE) refers to as academic impact of lost instructional time. The activities designated in this SAM are intended to meet this requirement, and these funds must be spent in \\r\\naccordance with the parameters outlined below. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit.

The allocation expands our current efforts to retain excellent teachers where our students need them most \\r\\nand sustain educator talent in schools through comprehensive and strategic supports at the district-level. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis program allocates BTLT funds to support Model Teachers, Peer Collaborative Teachers (PCTs), and Master Teachers for Bronx schools. The funding \\r\\nof teacher leadership roles aims to increase a collaborative learning culture, drive instructional improvements by modeling local effective practices, \\r\\nand shift school communities towards more innovative models of teacher collaboration.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese specific BTLT funds for SY 2021-2022 support schools in funding the salary addition of teacher leadership roles. Because the funds support \\r\\nteacher leadership to drive collaboration and capacity-building across the school by leading adult teams, schools that selected a team of teacher leaders\\r\\n (at least two teacher leaders) were allocated $10,000 subsidies for teacher leader salary additions. Schools that received a teacher leadership allocation\\r\\n from another Central programming, and did have two teacher leaders selected apart from that allocation, were not eligible to receive a BTLT allocation.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funds for this allotment will be placed in the allocation category \\n\\n ARPA Bronx Teacher Leadership Teams\\n\\n. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific guidance has been provided to the schools and districts regarding the allocation amount for their teacher leaders.

PCTs \\r\\nreceive 20% release time, to perform work related to their teacher leader role, which is funded by the school's budget. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPCTs receive $12,500 as a salary addition, which is included in the teacher leaders semi-monthly paycheck over the course of the school year.  At the time of this \\r\\nmemorandum, schools have selected teachers from the pool of qualified candidates to staff into the teacher leadership role at the beginning of the school year. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLead Coach Teacher Leadership\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLead Coaches are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the NYC Teaching Collaborative program at their school.  This includes supporting their colleagues through \\r\\na variety of activities including providing coaching and support to pre-service teachers, fulfilling program responsibilities, facilitating professional learning in teacher development, \\r\\nand acting as program ambassadors. This work supports the preparation and hiring of new teachers in high-need certification areas and districts. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLead Coach duties can be assigned to teachers who are already staffed in the PCT role in Galaxy for SY 2021-2022.  Funds are only available to schools hosting the NYC Teaching \\r\\nCollaborative program that have self-funded Peer Collaborative Teachers and have elected to assign Lead Coach duties to one of those teachers in lieu of the teacher leadership \\r\\nresponsibilities they held in the Fall semester.

These remote activities are \\r\\nallowable pursuant to the Chancellor\\'s Regulation C-175 and based on Chancellor\\'s Policy for 2021-2022 school year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). Funds must be used to help \\r\\nmeet a wide range of needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students\\' \\r\\nacademic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underrepresented student subgroups. ARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA for Academic Recovery\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or \\r\\nwhat the United States Department of Education (USDE) refers to as \\n\\nacademic impact of lost instructional time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe activities designated in this SAM are intended to meet this requirement, and these funds must be spent in accordance with the parameters outlined below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is available for expenses incurred September 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022. Schools are encouraged to schedule funds and implement eligible programming as soon as possible. \\r\\nAs this is a temporary fund source, these funds cannot be used to hire full-time staff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, \\r\\nmust be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Education Recovery Services:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare instruction and related services made available to students with IEPs to help close gaps brought on by the pandemic\\'s disruption to learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprovide students with targeted services that will supplement but not supplant students\\' IEP programs and services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare targeted at the needs of individual students based on the impacts of the pandemic as identified in the teacher\\'s assessment of each student\\'s progress toward IEP goals\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nare being made available to all students with IEPs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill be based on all areas for which they receive special education or related services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill be delivered in a manner that addresses inadequate progress toward grade level standards or skills that may have been lost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional information on programmatic expectations for Special Education Recovery Services must be reviewed in advance of schools utilizing these funds and can be found on the \\r\\n\\n\\nInfoHub\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools must utilize posting templates to staff the special education recovery services program. To bolster or enhance interest in the program, and where allowable as \\r\\noutlined in the allowable cost factors below, schools may utilize a Community-Based Organization (CBO) to provide supplemental enrichment activities related to recovery services, \\r\\nand should refer to the list of approved \\n\\nvendors\\n\\n on the InfoHub. Schools are encouraged to use Multiple Task Award Contracts (MTACs) to procure these services. \\r\\nMTACs are pre-established price and service agreements that enable schools to quickly procure a wide variety of services from fully vetted providers at negotiated prices. \\r\\nMTAC service categories relevant to this SAM include Counseling Services, Tutoring/Homework Assistance, Reading and Literacy Support, and Social Emotional Learning. \\r\\nProcurements above $25K require a competitive process, which is executed by DOE schools/offices via the MTAC tool. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo log in to the \\n\\nMTAC tool\\n\\n and use your Outlook credentials.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo view a tutorial on how schools can use the \\n\\nMTAC Tool\\n\\n and print handout.\\r\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAllocation Methodology\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds may be spent by schools in a way that meets the needs of their unique student population given that all spending falls under the allowable cost factors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE After-School Instruction:\\n\\n Funds have been allocated proportionally based on the number of students with IEPs at each school location. \\r\\nSchools are funded to provide 8 hours per week of teacher and paraprofessional per session over a 9-week period for every 15 students with IEPs. As students sign up for special \\r\\neducation recovery services and are programmed for instruction in STARS, schools must monitor their allocations to ensure the program is staffed to the needs of the students \\r\\nparticipating in services. Adjustments to the allocations will be made in the Spring. Additionally, schools may use this allocation for an MTAC to utilize a CBO partner or partners \\r\\nto provide instructional services directly related to Special Education Recovery Services as described above.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive 80% of the allocation amount for per session, and 100% of the OTPS allocation. Adjustments to the allocations based on student participation will be made in the Spring.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE Intervention Training:\\n\\n Funds are allocated based on material costs and teacher or para per diem to receive training in DOE approved interventions. \\r\\nRefer to the \\n\\nEvidenced Based Interventions\\n\\n section below for a breakdown of the number of days considered in this allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive 100% of the allocation.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE RS Related Services:\\n\\n Funds have been allocated proportionally based on the number of students with IEP mandates for each \\r\\ntype of related service with additional funds provided for students with risk factors. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive 80% of the allocation amount. Adjustments to the allocations based on student participation will be made in the Spring.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE Counseling:\\n\\n Funds are allocated using the same methodology as other related services described above. Additionally, schools may use this allocation \\r\\nfor an MTAC to utilize a CBO partner or partners to provide counseling services directly related to Special Education Recovery Services as described above.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive 80% of the allocation amount. Adjustments to the allocations based on student participation will be made in the Spring.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery SE Planning Prep:\\n\\n An additional $10M is allocated for case managers to complete Special Education Recovery Services planning, \\r\\nincluding the completion of the parental notices in SESIS, in accordance with the MOA developed on September 17, 2021.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools will receive 100% of the allocation amount.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecovery Services Reserves\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA reserve fund has been established for schools requiring additional funds to provide the level of services required. Schools may submit requests to their BCO Special Education Director and \\r\\nBudget Director via a \\n\\nweb form\\n\\n established for that purpose, available on the InfoHub in the coming weeks. \\r\\nUpon confirmation of the need, the BCO will submit to DFDC and SEO/ORS for final review and disbursement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpecial Education Recovery Services - Required Activities for All Schools\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBelow is the list of required activities for these funds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructional Afterschool Program School Allocation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds from the \"Instructional Afterschool Program School Allocation\" provide per session and 6th period coverage funding for special education teachers and per session \\r\\nfor paraprofessionals to provide small group instruction and support as outlined above. If schools are unable to secure special education teachers through a local posting, \\r\\na range of alternative staffing options are available, including a local general education teacher posting. As stated above, schools may utilize funds to provide enrichment \\r\\nservices through CBO staff in an effort to enhance interest in the program. Schools are strongly encouraged to ensure staff are trained in DOE-approved \\r\\n\\n\\nintervention programs\\n\\n. \\r\\nPosting templates are available on the \\n\\nInfoHub\\n\\n.\\r\\nFor any ongoing staffing challenges, principals must contact their BCO for support in contract/P4 issuance. In the event that teachers and/or paraprofessionals are staffed via \\r\\ncontracting or P4 issuance, the BCO will take steps to reduce the schools per session allocation accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nK-12 Instructional Materials\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds have been allocated to support schools in purchasing instructional supplies and materials necessary to deliver special education recovery services. Funds can be used for:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeneric supplies such as paper, ink, notebooks, classroom materials, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscriptions, such as additional student licenses for interventions or online access to supplemental instructional programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntensive Small Group Intervention\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on screener results, some students may require more intensive supports and targeted interventions. For these students, schools must employ evidence-based interventions \\r\\nand have a clear process of documenting and monitoring pre-referral supports.

ARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the United States Department of \\r\\nEducation (USDE) refers to as academic impact of lost instructional time. The activities designated in this SAM are intended to meet this requirement, and these funds must be spent in \\r\\naccordance with the parameters outlined below. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, \\r\\nmust be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis allocation can be used to purchase student licenses (for the screener each school identified for use during the selection window) associated assessment materials \\r\\nor companion support materials, professional learning from the assessment vendor, other professional learning related to the analysis, and use of screener data to inform \\r\\nnext instructional steps, and for related work.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds are to be scheduled in the allocation category \\n\\nARPA Academic Recovery Screener\\n\\n and can be used to \\r\\nsupport screener work throughout fiscal year 2022. Unspent funds from this allocation cannot be rolled over into fiscal year 2023 school budgets. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDocumentation must include evidence for the purchase of licenses and/or assessment resources and/or associated professional learning for the assessment.

The purpose \\r\\nof the initiative is to drive innovation and advance equity by empowering students and communities to play an active role in school formation and transformation. \\r\\nThis funding is intended to support innovations designed to address system inequities, ensuring youth empowerment so that all students have opportunities to \\r\\nbuild their identities as learners and develop the capacity for agency and autonomy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn year one, the initiative received over 250 applications from design teams across all 5 boroughs. 90 teams participated in a series of Design Days \\r\\nfrom fall 2019 to spring 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDOE is resuming the Imagine NYC Schools initiative by establishing a sustainable, scalable entity for NYC school innovation called \"Design Lab\". The objective of Design Lab is to serve as a catalyst for school transformation by supporting communities through a collaborative design process. Design Lab will equip diverse teams of school designers with processes, tools, and mindsets to tackle complex design challenges and develop innovative, homegrown solutions to the challenges we face in education today.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese grants are for elementary and middle school design teams for one year only. The funds are intended for existing schools to design and prototype changes in \\r\\ntheir school curricula, pedagogy, and processes in alignment with the Chancellor\\'s instructional principles and in support of innovative work to eliminate \\r\\ndisproportionality in access, opportunity and outcomes. Through community engagement and a youth-centered approach, these school teams will complete design challenges \\r\\nwith coaching from the Office of School Design and this funding support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding will be placed in the \\n\\nTL Imagine Schools\\n\\n or \\n\\nTL Imagine Schools CW\\n\\n \\r\\nallocation categories.

These funds support the per session needs for the Innovation Grants \\r\\nand will cover teacher teams who are attending professional learning sessions (training rate) and writing curriculum as part of their initiative.  In some cases, curriculum will be \\r\\nexpanded to embed CRSE into units of math study; in other cases, place-based STEAM project-based learning units of study will be created.

These efforts should be led by a diverse team of school stakeholders who can create, execute, monitor, and revise the multi-year plan for restorative transformation and implementation. When implemented effectively, restorative practices lead to welcoming and caring school environments where all students, staff, families, and partners feel welcome, safe, and necessary. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRJATs are expected to meet on a regular basis to analyze current data trends on school culture; develop and execute action plans for training and implementation of Tier 1, 2 and 3 restorative practices; communicate and partner with all community stakeholders around these paradigm shifts; and revise school operations including discipline procedures, so that they are restorative in nature and inclusive for all. Funds in the \\n\\nARPA Restorative Justice Action Teams \\n\\nallocation category are to be used to compensate eligible adult and hourly student RJAT team members. The allocation amounts vary based on committee size and composition. On average, the allocations would cover 30 hours of per session per adult committee member and 40 hours of student aide funding per youth member and thus would be sufficient for two-hour meetings, twice per month, from December through June.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOSYD selected schools to receive this allocation through a review process that identified schools that have already taken initial steps towards whole-school implementation including the establishment of RJATs, the training of school staff on Tier 1 Restorative Practices, and the participation in various other restorative trainings and workshops.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Overview\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA).

The initiative provides additional support to specific districts identified as experiencing a substantial increase in immigrants.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese funds can be used for activities that provide enhanced instructional opportunities for immigrant students.  Please note that immigrant students are not necessarily English Language Learners (ELLs) and ELLs may or may not be immigrants.  For the purpose of this funding, immigrant students are defined as individuals who were not born in any U.S. state (this includes the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico); and have not been attending one or more schools in any one or more states for more than three full academic years (the months need not be consecutive). \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPermitted uses of these funds include the following activities:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentification and acquisition of curricular materials, educational software and technologies to be used in the program.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily literacy, parent outreach and training activities designed to assist parents in becoming active participants in the education of their children.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport for personnel, including teacher aides who have been specifically trained, or are being trained, to provide services to immigrant students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvision of tutorials, mentoring and academic or career counseling for immigrant students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBasic instructional services directly attributable to the aforementioned school districts, including costs for additional classroom supplies, transportation costs, or other costs directly attributable to such services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther instructional services that are designed to assist immigrant students to achieve in elementary and secondary schools in the United States, such as programs of introduction to the educational system and civics education.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool activities, coordinated with community-based organizations, institutions of higher education, private sector entities, or other entities with expertise in working with immigrants, to assist parents of immigrant students by offering comprehensive community services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Division of Multilingual Learners (DML) has established similar guidelines for these funds, which can only be used to provide supplementary services to immigrant students (who may or may not be ELLs).  For school year 2021-2022, priority areas for the use of this part under ESSA - Immigrant Funds are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExtended day programming (e.g., before school, after school, Saturday program) to provide targeted, small-group instruction and credit recovery support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImplementing strong student supports to increase graduation rates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunity-based and school-based programming (e.g., before school, after school, Saturday program) to strengthen partnerships between immigrant families and schools. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloping new and/or enhancing existing programs for newcomers (meeting criteria defined above).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupplementing the opening or growth of Transitional Bilingual Education programs and/or Dual Language programs serving immigrant students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional learning on meeting the needs of immigrant students and effective instructional practices.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEach school must use the funds to support their immigrant students by developing a plan that integrates the above into the following three components:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDirect instruction supplemental program for immigrant students \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional development that bolsters the instructional practice of teachers of immigrant students\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParental engagement activities that support parents of immigrant students\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanning for Title III programs should be based on the following ratio of services:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n60% for direct instruction \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10% for parental involvement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10% for professional development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n20% for OTPS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools with sufficient numbers of immigrant students (as reported to NYSED) and meet a minimum threshold are eligible for this funding. Schools receiving Immigrant Funds must submit an application, which includes a school plan and a budget narrative describing the use of this funding.  School Wide Program (SWP) schools that are conceptually consolidating their federal, state, and FSF/tax levy funds, as described in their schools’ 2021-2022 CEPs, are not required to submit a separate Immigrant Funds budget.  However, SWP schools must submit a description of the strategies/activities the school will implement to meet the needs of new immigrant students and ensure that the intent and purposes of the immigrant program funds are met. Schools can access the \\n\\nApplication for Title III Immigrant Programs\\n\\n to complete this process.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompleted applications must be submitted by \\n\\nFebruary 18, 2022 \\n\\nto their B/CO's Director of MLs/ELLs for review and approval. Approval of the application and plan is contingent upon review of the B/CO Director of MLs/ELLs, who will notify the school via email regarding the approval status.  Therefore, schools are highly encouraged to review the requirements outlined in this memorandum to ensure that the plan satisfies all requirements in order to avoid any delays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram Descriptions: Galaxy Requirements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn FY 2022, schools must select a program description in Galaxy to identify how funds are being spent to support immigrant students.  As funds are scheduled, schools will need to select one of the activity descriptions, from below, using the “Program” dropdown field in Galaxy.  The scheduling of funds must be aligned with your approved Title III Immigrant plan. Conceptually consolidated schools that use a different consolidated funding source to fund an immigrant program must use the program descriptions below to ensure proper tracking of funds being used to support immigrant students.  For example, a conceptually consolidated school using Title I to support an after-school program for immigrant students should still choose “T3 Immigrant ELL Instruction – After School” even though they are using Title I funds.  The total amount of funds identified with the new “T3” program descriptions below must be greater than or equal to the amount of the Title III Immigrant allocation for the school. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTitle III Immigrant Program Descriptions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant ELL Instruction – Before School\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant ELL Instruction – After School\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant ELL Instruction – Saturday Program\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant ELL Instruction – Other\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant Certified ELL Teachers (ESOL/Bilingual)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant Guidance/Counseling Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant Professional Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nT3 Immigrant Parent Involvement/Engagement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFS10 Snapshot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be scheduled in the\\n\\n Title III Immigrant \\n\\nand/or \\n\\nTitle III Immigrant Carryover \\n\\nallocation categories.

The UTR represents an effort by the New York City Department of Education, \\r\\nin collaboration with Queens College, to prepare teachers in a way that is directly aligned to the needs and demands of New York City students, schools, and school leaders. UTR's approach \\r\\ndeeply aligns clinical experience with pre-service teacher's coursework under the close and supportive guidance of UTR program staff, which includes NYCDOE staff and Adelphi University \\r\\nfaculty.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most important factors in a pre-service teacher's experience in UTR is their full-time one-to-one mentor. Pre-service teachers will receive ongoing strategic guidance from \\r\\ntheir UTR mentor, who will continually monitor progress toward stated pre-service goals. Mentors assess residents on their teaching practices and development, lesson planning, and ability \\r\\nto use inquiry to fully understand student learning. Mentors submit the assessments to a program-maintained data system in order to monitor progress. Program officers evaluate the mentors. \\r\\nAdditionally, residents provide mentors with feedback based on the program's mentor competencies. Mentors also use the competencies to self-assess, set goals, and reflect on progress. \\r\\nThis allocation will compensate the UTR mentors in developing and planning a revised UTR mentorship program in order to support pre-service teachers and ensure consistent high quality \\r\\ncoaching. This allocation will also compensate participating school staff in developing and building their programs to prepare pre-service teachers to enter their schools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchools who are participating in this project will have access to funds to be used exclusively for teacher per session and/or per diem.

Participatory budgeting empowers voters, promotes education and responsibility, and makes political participation more inclusive and representative of the city's demographics. It gives a voice to often-marginalized groups, such as students, who might otherwise be excluded from government processes. This funding will support the implementation of a project proposed, researched, and promoted by students, which will improve the students' quality of life at school.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn FY 2022, the 197 participating schools will each receive $2,750 to support the implementation of a school-based proposal voted on by the student body. Funding support is 100% tax levy and is intended to be used for any OTPS resource or service to facilitate the implementation of the selected proposal to benefit the school community. Funding can be scheduled in the following object codes: 100, 110, 199, 300, 338, 400, 451, 615, 622, 669, 676, 684, 685, 686, 689, and 695.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrincipals and/or their designee must work collaboratively with their designated participatory budgeting teacher-facilitator and the school's Participatory Budgeting Steering Committee to facilitate funding the students' proposals.

This initial allocation is intended for one year only; schools will be able to apply in the 2022-2023 school year to initiate new outdoor learning sites and/or \\r\\nexpand existing programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCollider Classroom\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn partnership with Lincoln Center Education, the Collider Classroom is a classroom design prototype for 21st century learning. A Collider Classroom includes a welcoming physical space, \\r\\na digital wall and technology that supplements instructional delivery, and learning spaces that encourage student-directed discussions and small group connections. The wall displays art \\r\\ncontinuously that is tailored to the emotions of young people, challenging them to move towards wholeness, and socio-emotionally preparing them to learn. The classroom then becomes an \\r\\nimmersive experience tailored visually and pedagogically to the needs of students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funds will enable schools to design a state-of-the-art classroom that promote students\\' social-emotional learning. The Collider Classroom will be a space where students will \\r\\nunderstand the importance of developing healthy identities and managing emotions, which then supports academic success.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEAM Enrichments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Imagine NYC Schools Design Lab offers increasing levels of support to school teams with defined plans for innovation and collaboration. For a small number of highly complex design challenges, \\r\\nImagine NYC Schools Design Lab will invite school communities to participate in a year-long \"design journey\", which offers participants tailored design support in the form of ongoing innovation \\r\\ncoaching and workshops scheduled at key design milestones. Under the umbrella of Design Lab, schools will participate in a STEAM initiative to grow project-based learning units of study around \\r\\nSTEAM at their schools.  School leadership will begin with a strong grade-level team who can turn-key learnings with another grade(s) next year. Intended outcomes include the creation of curricula, \\r\\nprograms and materials that will deepen teaching practices of adults and learning experiences of students in each building.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funds will support the named schools in providing their students and school communities with access to STEAM resources and gardens, which will create opportunities for hands-on learning in the \\r\\nfields of science, technology, and horticulture in alignment with each school\\'s vision and goals. The funds will support the design and development of STEAM labs and outdoor gardens, as well as the \\r\\nprocurement of the materials, equipment, and supplies needed to create rich learning experiences for students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Planning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Design Lab initiative seeks to affect system-wide impact, with increasing levels of support provided to teams whose ideas demonstrate potential. The Design Lab Sprint will be guided through \\r\\nthe design thinking process and supported in creating prototypes for initiatives that address the needs of their school community. Those teams that continue on in a \"design journey\" will be supported \\r\\nthrough implementation of their initiatives via innovation coaching, curriculum to support teams\\' ongoing design work, and working sessions held at important design sprints. In particular, the initiative \\r\\nseeks to support innovative solutions that tackle systemic inequities head on and address the needs of historically marginalized student populations such as multilingual learners, students with disabilities, \\r\\nstudents in temporary housing, and overaged/under-credited youth. Communities of school designers will leverage design thinking processes and mindsets to develop rigorous, rich, and relevant learning \\r\\nexperiences for students across NYC, and this funding will allow them to bring those experiences from design to implementation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunding will be placed in the \\n\\nCRRSA Innovative Education Models\\n\\n allocation category. \\r\\nFunding can be used to support the following OTPS costs:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupplies - General\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNon-Contractual Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParental Involvement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinting Services - Contractual\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffice Temp Services - Contractual\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransportation of Pupils - Contractual\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducational Consultants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Administrative Consultants\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstructional Curriculum and Staff Development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 90, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nInnovative Education Models Allocation Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: df\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDaniel Weisberg\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLawrence Pendergast\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     Shahzad Kazi\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPaul Byrne\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRiccardo White\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDaniella Phillips\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSteven Chambers\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDonna Taylor\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCherelle D.

Funds provided through ARPA must be used to help meet a wide range of needs arising from \\r\\nthe coronavirus pandemic, including activities and interventions that respond to students' academic, social and emotional needs and address the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on \\r\\nunderrepresented student subgroups. ARPA funds are temporary and supplemental.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn accordance with the state and federal ARPA guidance, school districts must use a portion of funds to support academic recovery activities or what the United States Department of \\r\\nEducation (USDE) refers to as academic impact of lost instructional time. The activities designated in this SAM are intended to meet this requirement, and these funds must be spent in \\r\\naccordance with the parameters outlined below. As with all federal funding, these funds are subject to monitoring and audit. All purchasing and payroll documentation, including timesheets, \\r\\nmust be retained on site at the school to support expenditures, and must be available to present upon request.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYC public schools will ensure students have access to equitable and affirming computer science education instruction and experiences that prepare them for college and career pathways. Computer Science (CS) education and computational thinking are part of the DOE's comprehensive approach to K-12 literacy and highlights that digital literacy is a fundamental literacy with the goal that each and every one of our students will graduate on the pathway to a rewarding career and long-term economic security, equipped to be a positive force for change in our communities and our City.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComputer Science for All (CS4All) works to ensure all NYC public school students learn computer science, with an emphasis on female, Black, and Latinx students. Through our work, students will be better prepared to utilize CS during their K-12 experience and after graduation. The grant will be used to support schools in focused work towards expanding exposure to computer science education, offering increased access to robust CS experiences, and fostering a sense of belonging in computer science for students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIndividual school allocations are determined by each school's expressed interest, grades served and funding availability. This funding further underscores the City's commitment to strengthening and sustaining equitable access to computer science education for all students. All standard operating procedures and fiscal year deadlines for procurement apply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA.  Advanced Placement Computer Science Preparation:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding supports student preparation for AP computer science coursework and the exam, as well as after school/weekend AP support. The aim is to ensure that high school students of all ethnicities and genders can prepare to take the AP CS exam to earn college credits. Schools will provide CS4All-curated prep materials and digital curriculum for teachers to take learning out of the traditional class period, and per session funding will support teachers to offer and develop robust prep sessions outside of the normal school day. Schools can also use these funds to build exposure experiences to recruit next year's diverse classroom of AP students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParticipating schools will:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tProvide students with access to the following experiences and document them:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh school students: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Increased student support in preparation for an AP CS exam via teacher-led afterschool and/or Saturday preparation activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\r\\nAssess current AP CS implementation and identify staff suited to run after school and/or Saturday AP CS exam student preparation activities:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAP CS Teachers:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Up to 20 per session hours to support planning and implementation of afterschool and/or Saturday \\r\\nactivities for students preparing to take an AP CS exam.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Teachers will provide after school student preparation opportunities by utilizing existing College Board \\r\\nresources, AP CS course materials, and other resources to expand existing AP CS implementation.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAP CS Supervisors:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Up to 10 per session hours for staff to support AP CS teachers in planning and coordinating after \\r\\nschool or Saturday student preparation activities including student-interest and/or project-based learning clubs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\tCreate and provide a detailed budget (via \\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncsoperations@strongschools.nyc\\n\\n )and schedule funds by March 18, 2022 that outlines:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter school calendar and meeting schedules \\r\\nwith students in connection to per session spending\\r\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDedicated teacher planning times for afterschool \\r\\nstudent preparation activities in connection to per session spending\\r\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDedicated teacher and school supervisor planning \\r\\ntimes or afterschool student preparation activities in connection to per session spending\\r\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpenses permitted in the grant include but are not limited to the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer session for staff developing and implementing related work, participating in meetings or working with students. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional development or technical assistance for staff to improve implementation, culture building, and planning for students.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDigital curriculum licenses to support enrichment in the subject area\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nB.\\tComputer Science Digital Fluency Standards and Certification:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding can be used to pay for teachers to attend Digital Literacy professional development.

All funds must be pre-encumbered and liquidated, as appropriate,\\r\\n to support Community School programs and services, and funds may only be used for these purposes. Schools will be required to complete a work plan to be submitted to and approved by \\r\\nOCS. This funding must also be spent in alignment with the Community Schools Fiscal and Operations Manual. The allocation per school or campus will be used for implementing the Assets \\r\\nand Needs Assessment and for initial programs and services aligned to the core features of a Community School, per below. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the 2021-2022 school year, the allocation will cover planning supports as follows: \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommunity Schools will receive support from OCS, including a Director of School Support to allocate funding and complete a work plan. \\r\\n\\t\\tSchools will have the option to contract with DOE-approved vendors. Schools should work with their BCO Budget Director and/or procurement \\r\\n\\t\\tspecialist to ensure Standard Operating Procedures are followed for all SAM procurements and vendor engagements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese funds can be used to provide per session activities. Schools are encouraged to identify a program lead to support with coordination.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBudget codes requested are for per session, professional services and reimbursement for student and caregiver participation (685, 686, 689, 695, 489a, 496).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds can be used in the following ways (more details on following pages):\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer Session Activities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReimbursement for Student and Caregiver Participation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPer Session Activities\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe funding is intended to be used by selected schools to conduct an Assets and Needs Assessment (A&N) and to implement initial programs and services aligned to the Community Schools \\r\\nstrategy. Each school will be required to use these funds to assemble a team in order to conduct an A&N. For more information on how to put together the A&N team and conduct the A&N, \\r\\nsee our \\n\\nAssets and Needs Assessment Tool & Guide\\n\\n. \\r\\nKey findings from the A&N will be used to begin planning the Community School strategy and approach at the school. Additional acceptable per session activities include those necessary to \\r\\nbegin implementation of the Community Schools program model. Key components of the Community Schools strategy are listed below:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpanded Learning Time (ELT):\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorking with the School Leadership Team, teachers and/or partner agencies plan for expanded learning and enrichment activities before, during, or after the school day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffectively link the school day to expanded learning activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify outside providers for ELT as necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExamples of ELT programming include tutoring programs, academic enrichment, arts and recreation, and club activities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttendance Improvement:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImplement Every Student, Every Day, NYCDOE's strategy for attendance improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActivities include identifying, tracking and following up with absent students daily, matching chronically absent students with Success Mentors, \\r\\n\\t\\tand partnering with communities to remove barriers to attendance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily and Community Engagement:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlan events that promote family and community empowerment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify and provide trainings and presentations to families at PTA meetings, school forums, parent teacher nights and other events so families are aware of available resources.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWellness and Integrated Supports:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify health and mental health services in conjunction with OCS.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify local community resources and partners that are aligned with school goals and needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide social emotional learning and mindfulness opportunities. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProfessional Services\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis funding is to be used to procure the services of vendors who can support the school with planning for implementation of the Community Schools model. Schools should explore \\r\\ndifferent vendor services in the areas of: program management, data analytics, academics, health and mental health services, youth development, expanded learning opportunities, family and community support, \\r\\nand wellness and integrated supports. Examples of professional services include:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupport conducting the A&N and engaging multiple stakeholders in this process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOffer data analysis, programming and operational planning to prepare for implementation of the Community Schools model.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAssist with developing the school's vision and mission related to whole child wellness and development, as well as building an integrated model for elevating the importance of adult and \\r\\n\\t\\tstaff wellness and self-care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProvide long-term planning and program management supports, which could include goal development, milestone tracking and progress monitoring, and implementing cycles of continuous improvement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify professional learning and curriculum to support staff with planning for attendance improvement and various academic and extended learning opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelop learning modules that advance teaching and learning in alignment with the school's Community School strategy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove communications with families and increase engagement of family and community stakeholders.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReimbursement for Student and Caregiver Participation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAligned to the Community School strategy that supports a child's family and learning both inside and outside of the classroom, schools may use funding in this category to reimburse students and caregivers for \\r\\nparticipation in eligible planning and implementation activities connected to the Community Schools program.  Examples include but are not limited to:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdult education classes,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTraining for parent leaders, and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSupporting access to social services.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be scheduled in the allocation category: \\n\\n ARPA Academic Recovery Community Schools Expansion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 98, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nARPA Community Schools Supplement Allocation Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: ydr\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYalenis Cruz\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSarah Jonas\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNikki Dimanche\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDr. Jawana Johnson\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

While implicit bias cannot be eliminated, its effects \\r\\ncan be reduced and mitigated. Educators and school leaders can use this awareness to craft and build new learning experiences, for all students and stakeholders, in a child's life.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE), the importance of this implicit bias and culturally responsive work is heightened as district and school staff make decisions, \\r\\non behalf of children, or interact with students on a daily basis. NYCDOE will work to fulfill the goals of increasing awareness about implicit bias and of \\r\\nreducing these biases by providing the Implicit Bias Awareness (IBA) workshops and the Facing History and Ourselves professional learning series. Inherent in this training will be a \\r\\nfocus on developing stakeholders' critical consciousness to promote greater systemic equity. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoals of the Implicit Bias Awareness (IBA) Sessions:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the sessions participants will learn about:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImplicit bias\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe brain science behind implicit bias\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow biases show up in society, the classroom and the school community\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrategies to mitigate the effects of our biases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParticipating schools agree to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntentionally identify appropriate stakeholders to complete the online Implicit Bias Awareness Sessions. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tThere are three self-paced modules that participants must complete before participating in the live Module 4 session.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify a coordinator to liaise with the Office of Equity and Access IBA team to confirm stakeholder attendance and to process time sheets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds may only be used to support per session for participants in the Implicit Bias Awareness sessions. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\tAll standard operating procedures and fiscal year deadlines for procurement with tax levy funds apply.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImplicit Bias Awareness (IBA) Funds should be scheduled using the allocation category \\n\\nTL Implicit Bias Awareness\\n\\n or \\n\\nTL Implicit Bias Awareness CW\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoals of the Implicit Bias Professional Learning Series:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring the sessions participants will learn about:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCulturally responsive and sustaining practices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEngaging in a deep analysis of history to challenge participants to stand up to bigotry and hate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloping understanding of equity research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParticipating schools agree to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsure selected staff complete four 90-minute sessions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentify a coordinator to liaise with the OEA team to confirm stakeholder attendance and to process time sheets on a monthly basis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds may only be used to support per session for participants in the Implicit Bias Professional Learning series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFunds should be scheduled using the allocation category \\n\\nTL Implicit Bias PL\\n\\n or \\n\\nTL Implicit Bias PL CW\\n\\n.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload a copy of the School Allocation Memorandum No. 99, FY 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAttachment:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1 - \\n\\nImplicit Bias Awareness Workshops Allocation Summary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLO: df\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nC:    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGary Knight\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t     \\tDarnese Olivieri\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDeonca Renee \\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoseph Daniele\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJacqueline McAllister \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNYCDOE Division of Finance Website Navigation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",
